</p>A few months ago, I happily took up responsibility of handling social media &amp; blogging for a useful web-startup. Maybe because I was doing it 'right' for some other projects and for myself. So sun was rising from east, people were alive and life was normal.</p>

</p>And then shit hit the fan.<sup>*</sup> I still remember the fine morning I sat down with a mug of coffee to schedule some tweets and write a post for the startup. If it was my account or one of my projects, it'd have been a 10-20 min job. Easy.</p>

</p>But for this one, I sat for an hour, gazing at screen, reading, brainstorming and even gasping. But nothing happened, next day - nothing, 5 days -nothing and even 2 months - nothing! I could not get to reach out as that brand.</p>

</p>Everything is clearer now. Now I know what happened. I was trying to market something I didn't even know. I realized that marketing isn't a department sitting in office shouting to people and gathering 'data'.</p>

</p><strong><em>Marketing is a reflection of your inner intentions and sharing of vision. It's communication between to your co-creators - your users, your customers and you.</em></strong></p>

</p>And I, sitting miles away from the headquarters of the web-startup, not at all connected to what they were thinking, planning could not do anything. I could just talk and know that much and make plans. No <a title="shit loads users" href="http://www.64notes.com/how-to-get-loads-of-customers-users-for-every-thing-you-do">shit loads users</a>, no <a title="trendsetting" href="http://www.64notes.com/be-trend-setter">trendsetting</a>. Nada.</p>

</p>Marketing is not throwing off tweets, printing banners, making facebook pages, getting traffic, writing blog or advertising or any of that shit. Its communication - like the one happens between two players in a football team.</p>

</p>They talk, they decide, they agree, <a title="they adapt" href="http://www.64notes.com/change-or-die">they adapt</a>.</p>

</p>And one thing more - in a football tea, most of that happens without words because medium hardly matters. Basics are same. Tweets, Blogs, Updates, Emails, posters all are medium.</p>

</p>Don't bother about the medium much. Just focus on what you want to communicate. What do you want to tell your customer today? What do you want to <a title="ask your customer today" href="http://www.64notes.com/how-to-build-so-they-will-come">ask your customer today</a>? Is it easy for him to answer? Do you carry on the conversation or shut them off?</p>

</p>How do you approach marketing? Does your business have a marketing department? Are your other departments involved in marketing? Are you involved in marketing? Was I able to change your views on it?</p>
