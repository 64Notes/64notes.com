<p><em>Dear Co-founder,</em></p>

<p>You already know the things I am about to say here. They are dead obvious; but that's the problem - they are <strong>dead</strong> obvious.</p>

<p>You are not the best programmer in the world, I've seen better ones. Nor am I the best designer in the world, you've seen better ones. <strong>None of us is the best person out there.</strong> But you know what?<strong> That's irrelevant! Because we are best for each other.</strong></p>

<p>I have not seen anyone who brings out <strong>this</strong> best in me. We just fit in all of this perfectly well. I can hire a programmer, you can hire a designer. <strong>But we cannot hire a co-founder</strong>. There is no end to the ideas and inspiration that flows when I am with you.</p>

<p>If someone was to tell me, "You suck!" - I might laugh and ignore, or just punch him in the face. But when you say it... hell you don't even need to say it. I know when you're thinking that. I appreciate so much this <strong>profound understanding and comfort-level that we've created.</strong></p>

<p>I appreciate having you - who can tell me on the face that it was just another excuse of mine to delay shipping.<strong> I appreciate that we can be blunt with each other.</strong> Try doing that with your girlfriend - she will kick you in the balls!</p>

<p>It's not about the startup. Not at all! It's about we being together and then something meaningful coming out of it. You know it, we've created amazing experiences together!</p>

<p><strong>When I am not a match to your vision (of me), don't give up on me!</strong> Hope for me, call for me and except me. You will see me rise. If either of us give-up on the other one, we've failed ourselves.<strong> I appreciate you raising the bar every time we interact (and when we don't).</strong> I appreciate you expecting more from me.</p>

<p>When you're not along, it seems impossible to dive-in and live this dream. It is such a relief to know that you will dive-in with me. <strong> I won't walk the line alone.</strong></p>

<p>Do you think I can do this alone? Ha! I am so lazy that it takes me months to correct a typo. Do you think you can do this alone? You can't even eat a burger properly! <strong>Now, correcting typo and eating burgers has nothing to do with the startup - but you know what I mean. In fact, only you know what I mean.</strong></p>

<p>Maybe we can do this alone, but with each other we will love doing it!</p>

<p>I am flawed, so are you and that's how we roll! Flaws are hinges that lock us together. <strong>If we were smooth as perfect - we'd slip past each other.</strong></p>

<p>This feels so perfect, effortless, inspiring and full of life. Like it is meant to be. Like it is inevitable. <strong>Let's leave our big noses (ego) aside, and enjoy this lined-up life. </strong>Let's be together... hell, when were we gone? Since very first time we met, to this date - we've been together.</p>

<p><strong>I admit it! I want to do this with you. How about you?</strong></p>

<p><em>Yours,</em><br/>
<em>Co-founder.</em></p>

<p><strong>PS: </strong>If you feel the same, send this to your co-founder. Let me know how they reacted. And wish me luck that it'd work for me too. :)</p>
