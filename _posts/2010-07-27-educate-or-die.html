People think it's all about fooling people into buying your stuff. They are ready to take advantage of their ignorance. But don't worry, they won't go far - generations get smarter and smarter. If you won't educate your customers - your competitor will. You loose.

Educating your customers (without trying to sell) empowers them and empowered customer trusts you. Trust is the most dominant factor that decides if they will buy from you or not.

Imagine a computer company (A) telling you that this is best stuff in market (that's what they usually do) and you buy it. (That's what is actually <!--more-->happening with highly over-rated Intel's i3 / i5 / i7 Core processors.)

Now there is another company (B) which <a title="asks you all that you plan to do and all your interests" href="http://www.64notes.com/how-to-build-so-they-will-come">asks you all that you plan to do and all your interests</a> and suggests you what is best for you. They also tell you why it's best for you.

B doesn't even need to tell me that A was lying, I know they were. Will I ever buy from A again? Never!

It's not even about telling them what is best - that's not educating them is; that's fooling them. <strong>Tell them what's best for them.</strong>

Educating customers is so important and <a title="yet so untapped." href="http://www.64notes.com/delhi-street-business-plan">yet so untapped.</a> You can really rock any market.
