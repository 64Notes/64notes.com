What is the best way to build an audience / a following and what is the best way to keep them, grow them and turn them into customers?

<strong>Teaching!</strong>

<em>Teach them why, how, what &amp; who. Teach them what you know &amp; believe.</em>

When I say teaching, I don’t mean a classroom situation where teaching tells you ‘the truth’ and expects you to believe it and <a title="questioning it is annoying &amp; stupid." href="http://www.64notes.com/education-killed-956-entrepreneurs">questioning it is annoying &amp; stupid.</a>

Teaching means sharing, telling stories, inspiring (not motivating) them to do something remarkable – inspiring them to be best.

<em>This all is about building trust &amp; relationship, once that is in place your audience will be your customers too.</em>

Use blog, twitter, newsletter for this purpose –<!--more--> teach, share and add value to their lives. There is no better way of marketing. It’s viral, it’s loved and people pay attention, they advocate for you.
<blockquote class="right">“...teaching is a mutual experience.”</blockquote>
[Off-topic: Btw, did you<a href="http://eepurl.com/N-CJ" target="_blank"> join the Secret Notes newsletter</a>?]
<h3>Some brands &amp; people who teach to reach:</h3>
<h4><a title="37 Signals" href="http://www.37signals.com/">37 Signals</a></h4>
If you are a designer, you know how awesome their blog – Signal vs Noise is. They share their day-to-day learning and why behind their decisions. Will I ever doubt their product? No!
<h4><a title="Blogussion" href="http://www.blogussion.com/">Blogussion</a></h4>
Alex, 17 years old owner, writes 5 posts every week teaching something new about blogging every day. His newsletter teaches you all his learning about blogging. The trust he built-in blogging and thesis theme community led to a successful launch of his thesis skin.
<h4><a title="Pearsonified &amp; DIY Themes" href="http://www.pearsonified.com/">Pearsonified &amp; DIY Themes</a></h4>
I never thought I will use <a href="http://www.64notes.com/thesis" target="_blank">Thesis theme framework for WordPress</a>. It never made any sense to me. But just reading a few articles on Chris Pearson’s blog had so much impact on me that I ended up using thesis on all my WordPress sites.
<h4><a title="Seth Godin" href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth Godin</a></h4>
He churns out blog posts, books, free ebooks, videos, interviews and endless stuff – teaching us all he knows and believes. And you know how strong his following is, his books sell like hot cakes.
<h2>DIY Teaching</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Get a blog if you don’t already have one. Write posts, at least once a week, teaching them what you learned. If you didn’t learn anything – make it up, crack jokes. Make it human.</li>
	<li>Get a twitter account if you don’t already have one. Follow your industry leaders and start tweeting what you learned, articles you loved, and some random updates.</li>
	<li>Don’t miss any opportunity to teach &amp; learn – teaching is a mutual experience. If there are no opportunities create them! Do webinars, podcasts, travel!</li>
</ul>
<strong>Whom are you teaching today? You can start with me.</strong>
