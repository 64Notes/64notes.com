  <blockquote>Aarohan (www.arhn.in) is the national-level annual techno-management fest of NIT Durgapur. From a modest festival which began in 2003, in its mighty eleventh edition, it now stands tall among the best in the country. In fact, it gives me immense pleasure to inform you that Aarohan has now become the second largest technical festival of Eastern India, where over 3000 young enthusiasts from around 500 colleges participate in different competitions. </blockquote>
  <blockquote>Inspiratie 2013 is an ideal podium where we get to hear the stories of those who refused to quit, dared to breach the norms and envisage the idea of a progressive society.  We promise each one a look into the world of those brilliant people, who have helped paint the canvas of society, and more importantly, what inspired them to do so.</blockquote>
