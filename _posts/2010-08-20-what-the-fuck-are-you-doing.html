If you are bogged down in doing what you are <em>supposed</em> to do, then…
<ul>
	<li>You are not doing enough.</li>
	<li>You are not being yourself.</li>
	<li>You are following convection, a rat race.</li>
	<li>You don't have an opinion.<!--more--></li>
	<li><a title="You don't think you matter" href="http://www.64notes.com/will-it-matter">You don't think you matter</a> and you are proving it.</li>
	<li>You can't<a title=" make a decision" href="http://www.64notes.com/make-right-decision-for-start-up"> make a decision</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>You are not an entrepreneur.</strong></li>
</ul>
Do what you feel for, what you believe in what you were born to do. Be yourself.
