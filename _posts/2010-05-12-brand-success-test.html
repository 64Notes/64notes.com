<blockquote>“...my cat. I Abrahamed (manifested) her.”

<a href="http://www.Abraham-Hicks.com">Abraham Hicks:</a> “We’ve become a verb.”</blockquote>
How do you know if your brand has crushed it? How do you know it’s about to? Here is a <em>good</em> litmus test: <strong>People love you.</strong>

How do you know that people love you? Here is a <em>great</em> litmus test: <!--more--><strong>You become a verb.</strong>

<em>“I think I will Google it”</em>

<em>“I am facebooking / orkuting.”</em>

<em>“Tweeps / Tweets / Get twitter.”</em>

<em>“It’s an Apple thing.”</em>

<em>“I Abrahamed her.”</em>

<em>“You Crushed it!”</em>

You don’t make yourself a verb – that’s screwy. You let your customers make you one. And you let them do that by being awesome. It is not "the" ultimate test. but it is a good one.

This is another reason to get a brandable name and not keyword thing and another reason to focus on bringing out the product instead of perfecting it.
