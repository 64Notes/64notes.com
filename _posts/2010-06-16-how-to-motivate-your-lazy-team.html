While working on projects in a team, my biggest problem was not seeing people being as passionate as me. Not even close.

I don't know about you but my heart burns when I see people just being around. But burned hearts doesn't do much except burning heart, so what can we do to motivate them?<!--more-->

First thing first, you can't motivate them. If their life and desires failed to do that - then what are you? All we can do is inspire them by clarity of our example.

Instead of complaining about them or anyone, let's deliver. Deliver failure but keep it moving. People like ideas that move about instead of being stuck.

People like results. Give them that and they will replicate it.
