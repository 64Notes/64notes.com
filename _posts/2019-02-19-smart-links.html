  <a href="/design/online-payments-for-indian-businesses/">Payment Links</a>,
  launched in 2016, achieved the product-market fit for Instamojo.
  Lakhs of MSMEs use Payment Links to collect payments every day.
</p>

<p>
  Our products are self-explanatory; we spend no money on activating a customer.
  80% of our customers adopt our DIY products within 55 minutes of Signing up.
</p>

<p>
  Payment links & buttons are on the customer's website; before the
  competition picks up the phone to call.
</p>

<p>
  Customers always want more. We love that about our customers‚Äî
  they expect Instamojo to get better. Speaking to them we learned
  that Payment Links are good but <em>"it could be better"</em>. ‚ù§Ô∏è
</p>

<h2>The Problems</h2>

<p>
  Businesses use Payment Links to close sales. Their customers raise a query
  over a call, WhatsApp/Instagram chat, SMS, etc. They send Payment links
  to their customer once the price is final.
</p>

<p>
  As these businesses grow, they become complex. New departments, processes,
  and software emerge. Payment Links often need tech-effort to make it work.
</p>

<p class="highlight-1">
  From being a pain-killer, Payment Links could become a pain.
</p>


<h2>Making sense of customer requests</h2>

<p>
  Our customers range from individuals to companies serving pan-India.
  We were getting hundreds of feature requests from them.
</p>

<p class="highlight-1">
  The customer is always right‚Ää-‚Ääabout the problems they face and they trust professionals to find the right solutions.
</p>

<p>
  While taking note of their feature requests, we discussed:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Why they wanted the feature. What problem would it solve for them?</li>
  <li>How do they solve the problem today?</li>
  <li>If we had the feature today, what else would they need to switch
     from their existing solution?</li>
</ol>
<p class="highlight-1">
  It's not enough to take a feature request and build it. There will be no
  adoption if the switching cost is high.
</p>

<p>
  Speaking to them, we learned these were the most important problems they
  wanted <em>us</em> to solve:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Dynamic payment amount & timing:</strong>
    Eg: Advance payment for a commissioned work,
    early bird/discounted tickets for an event, etc
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Data collection with payment:</strong> Businesses have a stack
    of departments to deliver the end results. Each department needs data
    to work. Eg: warehouse, shipping, admission department in school/colleges, etc
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Looking professional & trustworthy:</strong> businesses wanted
    the change the design & content. This would ensure consistency with their brands
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Out of the umpteen feature requests, we chose to prioritise 15 critical ones.
  How do we fit that without making everything overwhelming?
</p>

<p>How do we fit this...</p>

<p>...and keep the experience easy & simple?</p>

<p>
  Our design team, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohamed-omair-ansari/" target="_blank">Mohamed Ansari</a>
  & <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sreenathkotteri/" target="_blank">Sreenath Kotteri</a>,
  took this challenge and created magic for our customers.

</p>

<p>Creating a Smart Link is as simple as creating a Payment Link (reanamed to Quick Links).</p>

<div class="img img--120cent">
  <p class="text-center">
    <img
      src="/images/2019/smart-links/create-smart-link-flow.png"
      alt="Creating Smart Link is a simple & easy, in line with Payment Links."
    >
  </p>
  <p> </p>
</div>

<p>
  When creating a Smart Link:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Business critical features come first. Eg: amount, expiry date, etc</li>
  <li>Everything else is optional and grouped where the feature had
    similar end results. Eg: Data collection features are in one group</li>
</ul>
<p>
  While it's simple, it covers everything our customers asked for:
</p>

<div class="img img--100cent">
  <p class="text-center">

      alt="Smart Link hides the complexity of features with a simple interface."
    >
  </p>
  <p></p>
</div>


<h2>The "Smart" in Smart Links</h2>

<p>
  Smart Links are not about more features. They are smart because they understand the intention behind the feature.
</p>

<p>
  Let's take a feature request from our list earlier:
</p>

<div class="img--80cent">
  <p class="text-center">
    <img
      src="/images/2019/smart-links/payment-links-example-feature-request.png"
      alt="Taking one feature request as an example: I have to manually ask for GST number to raise an invoice."
    >
  </p>
  <p> </p>
</div>

<p>
  At first, the problem seems to be simple‚Äîgive a checkbox to collect GSTN?
</p>

<p>
  But the real problem is invoicing. There are other data required for invoicing, apart from the GST Number:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Billing Address (important for GST Invoicing)</li>
  <li>Shipping Address (sale of a product that requires shipping)</li>
  <li>Billing & Shipping Addresses may be different.</li>
  <li>Company Name</li>
</ol>
<p>
  By clicking one checkbox, the business can take care of all these use cases:
</p>

<div class="img--80cent">
  <p class="text-center">
    <img
      src="/images/2019/smart-links/create-smart-link-shipping-billing-fields.png"
      alt="Create Smart Link offers collecting all relevant billing details with one checkbox."
    >
  </p>
  <span class="caption">
    By clicking one checkbox, businesses can collect everything required to generate a GST invoice.
  </span>
</div>

<p>
  This creates a problem for the payment experience.
  The customer making the payment would have to fill 10 fields:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Shipping Address:
    <ol>
      <li>Street Address</li>
      <li>State</li>
      <li>City</li>
      <li>Pincode</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Billing Address:
    <ol>
      <li>Street Address</li>
      <li>State</li>
      <li>City</li>
      <li>Pincode</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    GSTN
  </li>
  <li>
    Company Name
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Smart Links take care of that as well.
  The only mandatory fields for the customer are the address fields.
  Everything else is optional:
</p>

<div class="img--80cent">
  <p class="text-center">
    <img
      src="/images/2019/smart-links/smart-link-buyer-experince.png"
      alt="Smart Link can ask for a lot of information during the payment without overwhelming the user."
    >
  </p>
  <span class="caption">
    The customer making the payment only has to fill what's necessary.
    Businesses can ask for lot of details without overwhelming the customer.
  </span>
</div>

<p>
  <strong>Every feature in Smart Links is smart like that üòé.</strong>
</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p class="highlight-1">
  Within 60 days of launch, 7% of our monthly active users (MAU) adopted
  Smart Links with zero budget spent on marketing.
</p>

<p>
  They created beautiful Smart Links:
</p>

<div class="img--120cent">
  <p class="text-center">
    <img
      src="/images/2019/smart-links/beautiful-smart-links.png"
      alt="Our customers created beautiful Smart Links; some examples."
    >
  </p>
  <p> </p>
</div>

<p>
  We saw better adoption in the categories we researched & targeted with Smart Links. Smart Link users are serious and more likely to use our value-added services.
</p>


<h3>Defending margins</h3>

<p>
  Smart Links solve problems for lakhs of businesses and their customers. It also adds to Instamojo's competitive advantage in the payments business.
</p>

<p>
  Consider two things:
</p>

<p>
  <strong>First</strong>, there are companies dedicated to solving the problems
  we aim to solve with Smart Links. (Dynamic Pricing, Data Collection, and
  Landing Pages)
</p>

<p>
  Most of these companies offer their software on a subscription model (SaaS).
  MSMEs have an unpredictable cash flow and don't like a monthly/yearly subscription fee.
  The software is often too complicated to understand & use.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Second</strong>, the payments business is a low-margin business.
  With high competition in the market, most payment products suffer margin erosion.
  Especially when focused on big-ticket customers, where the customer has the
  pricing power.
</p>

<p>
  Smart Link solves both these problems:
</p>

<p>
  For the MSME, it brings the essentials from SaaS products at a predictable price.
  Pay when you use &mdash; they pay 2% + Rs.3 per transaction &mdash; no subscription & no upfront cost.
</p>

<p>
  When they can afford the paid SaaS products, they use webhooks to integrate Payment Links with their favourite products.
</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>
  For our customers, we are more than a payment gateway, shipping gateway, or loan gateway. We are partners in their business.
</p>

<p class="highlight-1">
  While our competition has to slash prices to acquire & retain customers,
  our customers are happy to pay more for the problems we solve.
