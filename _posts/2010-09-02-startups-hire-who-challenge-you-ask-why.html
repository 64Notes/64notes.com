There is a vacancy at your nearby corporate, guess who are they looking for? Someone with student syndrome who can fit into their culture system and adjust and compromise and… you get the idea.

There is a vacancy at a startup. Guess who are they looking for? Or rather… who should they look for?<!--more-->

They must look for someone who will <a title="demand a change" href="http://www.64notes.com/change-or-die">demand a change</a>. Who will ask <strong>“Why? What’s the point?”</strong>

Don’t get me wrong. I am not talking about the lazy bummer who will demand more comfort. I am talking about those who have better ideas and want to discover better ways of doing it, someone who want to challenge the status quo, someone who will say, <strong><em>“</em>Hey! Here is a better way of doing this”</strong> or even better, <strong>“Here is why we don’t need to do this.”</strong>

It’s not about accommodating to <a title="the vision" href="http://www.64notes.com/entrepreneurs-risk-takers">the vision</a> – but raising that vision because they have a different perspective.

In a startup, differences are an advantage and are used for leverage, for finding the highway – the better way.

No one can follow your vision, but they can align their vision with yours. Benefit from their personalities, instead of asking the unnatural, <strong>“Be something we want you </strong><strong>to be ignoring all that you are.</strong><strong>”</strong>
