<p>
  <strong>64Notes</strong> began as an experiment;
  I started sharing some of my notes on <strong>entrepreneurship, startups, business, and design</strong> online.
</p>

<p>
  Since then, it has made many things possible â€”
  conversations with interesting people, intense debates, appreciation, and opportunities.
  And personally, it's a timeline of evolution of my thinking.
