Now that you're here. I want to share a poem written by Zen master Hoshin just before his death:

**I came from brilliancy.**

**And return to brilliancy.**

**What is this?**

This line was one line short of the customary four, so the disciple said:

**"Master, we are one line short."**

Hoshin, with the roar of a conquering lion, shouted **"Kaa!"** and was gone.

**Poof!**

**Just like this page.** It doesn't exist or died or something.

True story.
