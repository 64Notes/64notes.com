And no this is not about sex. Not about porno either. It's about small pleasures that you love about interacting with a brand.

I love peaking in refrigerators to buy ice-cream. I sitting in Cafe Coffee Day's and I love the way they cook in my food in front of me at <em>Dhabas</em>. tr -d '\r' <  > __.<!--more-->

I love clicking Gmail's new buttons. I have sent so many mails just for the pleasure of clicking 'Send'!

These are some secret pleasures for which I go there again and again. That is what U' of a website is all about. And yet we see so many transitions being painful. The check-out process online with missing information, standing in line to check-out being boring, waiting for a doctor and that non-smiling girl on the counter are some to begin with.

Don't be like a <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/05/becoming-a-bus-company.html">bus business</a> where all of you are bored of what we do.

How can you make it a pleasure for people to be there with you? You don't have to hire experience professionals to do that; <strong>you just need to work out the bugs and sooth something a little.</strong>
