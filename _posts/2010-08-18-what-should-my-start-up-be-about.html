<strong>Q: I so want to do a start-up. But what should it be about?</strong> (Asked on a DM on Twitter)

[<a href="http://www.64notes.com/twitter">Are you Following me on Twitter</a>]

<strong>A: </strong>Start-up is not about starting your venture - it's more about taking the plunge as entrepreneur. Usually first start-up is about something you are passionate about or have fun doing. But it really doesn't matter what idea you get started with - you are going to evolve your preferences, vision and yourself.

Getting started is more important than 'about what'.

<strong>If you have an Idea:</strong> work on it

<strong>If you don't:</strong> work with a start-up or travel.

If you don't have any idea, go join a start-up and work with them, the environment there is really good at inspiring ideas and you get every benefit of start-up.

Traveling gives you new perspective and experiences.

<strong>In nutshell, start-up your idea if you can't, for whatever reason, help someone who is starting out.</strong>
