<p>
  <strong>64Notes</strong> started as an experiment when I decided to publish some private notes online.
  Most notes are about <strong>entrepreneurship, startups, business, and design</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Since then, it has made many things possible â€”
  conversations with interesting people, intense debates, and opportunities.
  Personally, I can look back and see my thoughts evolve.
