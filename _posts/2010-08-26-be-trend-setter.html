Every other company wants to copy what Apples does, what 37 Signals does and whatever the most successful brand in your niche does. I am not a left out either; I am always admiring what they do.

But what does it take to be one of them? What does it take to deliver that? What does it take to be iconic?

Often people try to copy the surface. They will replicate the body, the interface, the functionality and so on - that's just the surface. It's just a result.<!--more-->

What it takes is replicating the process, discussions, brain storming, ideas, work, thinking behind the result/surface.

Apple researches, thinks and gives so much attention to details - that's what it takes to build iconic iPad.

37 Signals spend endless hours discussing every word of their book - Rework. I am sure they spend 10 times that time in building and refining their products. That's what it takes to build Basecamp and such brilliant stuff.

At Blogussion, Alex spends weeks thinking, planning, executing and refining his design and posts. That's what it takes for next generation blogging.

See behind the surface. See how it works - replicate the principles, not the skin.
