<p>I started designing when I was in high-school. That's 7+ years of designing! Took me a long while to get started on writing about design.</p>

<ul class="posts-list">
  {% for post in site.categories.design %}
  <li class="post">
  <a href="{{ post.url }}" class="entry-title">
    <div class="post__meta">
    <date>{{ post.date | date: "%d %b, %Y" }}</date>
    </div>
    <span class="post__title">{{ post.title }}</span>
  </a>
  </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
