On a recent <a href="http://www.64notes.com/tag/rewalsar-trip">trip to Rewalsar (Tso-Pema)</a>, I noticed people going about lake with their prayer wheels. As a human, I wanted it. And I wanted it so bad.

The shop in front of my hotel was selling it but the price seemed too high, it always is (for tourists). Being the miser and non-tourist kind I am, I did what any customer would do:<!--more--> <strong>Ask other customers.</strong>

It was a bit difficult but not as difficult as overpaying and taught me anther great lesson:

Customers talk to other customers.(think: social media) Be where they will ask. And be the best for those who can answer - <a title="your present customers." href="http://www.64notes.com/turn-customers-into-brand-advocates">your present customers.</a>

Nothing markets you as good as your present customers.

Those who overpriced, are bastards in my eyes. Don't be one of them.
