This movie reminds me a lot about how to think like a kid i.e. think unlimited. You can be, do or have anything. Thought the film might have different message at heart but it inspires me to dream – dream big.

It's about two orphan brothers who run away from their aunt's home to magical city of Venice.  <em>(Note to Self: buy a home in Venice)</em><strong> </strong>There they explore awesome gang of orphan kids lead by <em>the Thief Lord.<!--more-->
</em>

They take on a project to steal something for loads of cash and end up being cheated. They follow the cheaters to discover the magic of age reversal and make their own decision.

<a href="http://www.64notes.com/my-mentor-was-a-5-years-old">The youngest of all kids is the one who knows the magic of the city</a> – I could completely relate to him. That's how I see the world too.

It is a must watch for all entrepreneurs but will make more sense to young entrepreneurs. But all entrepreneurs are young at hearts so… go watch it!

<strong>PS:</strong> It's fun to over rule your parents and have adults on your side in your mission. Discover how to lure them in.
