When looking for hiring people for your startup, what is more important - skills or mindset?

<strong>Skills </strong><strong>can be</strong><strong> taught but not mindset.</strong> In fact, they (co-workers) will learn most of the skills they need after they have joined. So a learning mindset is more important.<!--more-->

They will need to cope up with ever-changing decisions and directions, so having patience and enthusiasm is necessary.

Degrees, marks, resume cannot tell you about the mindset. Often those are written by someone charges few buck a page to type. They are found at unusual places, finding it hard to fit-in and unsatisfied with what is.

They want more challenges, they are not hard to spot - just keep your eyes, ears and mind open.
