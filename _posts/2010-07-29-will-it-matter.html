If you are reading this chances are that you are working on a start-up, thinking of one or you have a never-resting idea-getting soul. Whatever the reason is, I want you to ask yourself a question:

<strong>If you / your startup stops existing, will it matter to the world?</strong>

If<!--more--> it won’t, you are a no good! You are not doing anything that world needs. You are not being who you can be.

If yes, just keep doing it. And yes, do mention in comments what is it that you are doing. It takes courage to put it out there – let’s see if you have that courage. I won’t judge you, I won’t tell you if it’s good or bad. It’s not for me, it’s for you.

Speak up if you matter or it won’t matter at all.
