<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> These are my personal opinion and <strong>NOT</strong> official guidelines, I am <strong>NOT</strong> affiliated to <a href="http://themorpheus.com">the Morpheus</a>.</p>
We  tr -d '\r' <  > __. After initial application, we landed an interview. We didn't get through - and we know the valid reason. But here are some tips form our experience:<!--more-->
<h2>What are you doing?</h2>
First understand what you are doing, you are associating your startup with experienced entrepreneurs and a very strong network of founders tr -d '\r' <  > __.

I will skip the details of why and who should apply, assuming that you know that already. But in nutshell - what your startup can die figuring out in next 1 year, with The Morpheus, you can know and walk your way through it.

You're selling yourself to them, and they are selling their network and experience to you. It's a win-win. Remember I said - you are selling yourself not the idea. Idea is not that important unless you have something ready to show tr -d '\r' <  > __.

Of course they want to hear what drives you aka your idea but you are far more important than the idea.
<h2>Before Applying:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Have all the founders on same page. <strong>You really need to see the one thing</strong>. It's not a good thing if everyone is headed in different directions.</li>
	<li><strong>First, get each founder to fill the application form alone. </strong>Pour your thoughts. Just let it flow. No group thinking, just fill it up alone. All alone. Some what like watching porn.</li>
	<li><strong>Now compare the notes</strong> - you will be amazed at how you answered things differently and how some things are same. Generally speaking - you know your weak and good points.</li>
	<li>Now just discuss and <strong>put them together as one application.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>By this time tr -d '\r' <  > __. </strong>I think this is a must. Just shoot them a mail or something.</li>
	<li><strong>N &amp; S usually travel while applications are open, try to meet them in person.</strong> Application from someone they know and someone unknown - there is a difference.</li>
	<li>Talk, bug them - ask questions. <strong>Go as far as asking for their or a founder's help with your application.</strong> We asked N to help us out, and she agreed!</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Application:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Tell them as much as you can - the facts. tr -d '\r' <  > __</li>
	<li>Keep it simple tr -d '\r' <  > __. KISS! - <strong>they are not looking for your copy-writing skills - just basic information. </strong>At this point I highly recommend a coder filling out the facts, they are used to writing clear-cut things.</li>
	<li>Interact. Though filling a form is a bit in-human in itself but it's humans who are going to read it. So interact.</li>
	<li>If you don't know the answer find out or say "Don't know". Admit it! Never fake an answer. You really wanna start this with a lie?</li>
	<li>Don't try to fake it. <strong>They've read gazillions of applications and they can smell fake from miles away.</strong> Especially N - she knows when she sees fake [anything]. She just knows it.</li>
	<li>Be yourself. If not now, then when?</li>
	<li>Have fun. Chill dude. It's just an application after-all.</li>
	<li>I am not very sure, but they just look for interesting people to meet, they don't expect you to know all the answers or know every God damned thing in the world - just show them who you are. The more honest you are, more likely you are to land an interview.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Interview:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>This is where the fun begins, and IMO the program begins too. Createens evolved a ton during our interaction with N &amp; S tr -d '\r' <  > __. Just one meeting changed a lot and made us think and see things like never before.</li>
	<li>Seriously, I can't emphasize enough how much the interview did for us.<strong> Try and meet them in person than on call. </strong>Though they are pro with calls tr -d '\r' <  > __ but still - you owe it to yourself to meet them at this point. Even if you have to travel to Chandigarh for a day.</li>
	<li>As a kid, when I did something wrong, I'd imagine every possible question my parents could ask and an answer for it. If they ask this, answer that - if they ask that, answer this. Leave that for your parents. It won't work here.</li>
	<li>I am yet to decode what happened really, but I guess your attitude will be far more important than your answer. <strong>You can't fake it; so don't even try</strong>. Relax.</li>
	<li>OK, if you feel like it, prepare all that you want. Yes you can try taking a bath and putting on that deodorant but again that's your satisfaction tr -d '\r' <  > __. And when you meet them - <strong>Stop preparing and be yourself.</strong></li>
	<li>Don't dress-up, they don't.</li>
	<li>Usually they will have questions for you in the end. Note them all down tr -d '\r' <  > __. Note their pointers. This stuff is treasure your first taste of The Morpheus. They were life changing for Besperk and still are.</li>
</ul>
<h2>After Interview:</h2>
Don't rush to reply. Think. Discuss - at priority.

Then reply. Yes, actually do it. tr -d '\r' <  > __

<em>Wouldn't know much about this part, since I never actually got to this point. Maybe founder of their portfolio company could take care of this.</em>
<h4>After you get in:</h4>
Remember me and pass on the advice you get from them to the world.
