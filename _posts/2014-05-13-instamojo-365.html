title: 365 Days at Instamojo 
type: post
--- 

<p>It's been one year since I joined the <a href="https://www.instamojo.com/about">Instamojo gang</a>. During this one year, <a href="https://www.instamojo.com">Instamojo</a> has come from a <em>product-in-making</em> to a <em>product-in-evolution</em>.</p> 

<p>We've come from being an MVP to an evolving product used by thousands of people to collect payments online. These persons are from different worlds-they are freelancers, consultants, musicians, craftsmen, teachers, startups, local brands, film festivals, event organisers, media houses, publishers, and many more.</p>

<p>While most are finding online customers to be a major source of their newfound income. Some of our customers just discovered an alternate career by trying out an idea on Instamojo; realising their first entrepreneurial dream.</p> 

<p>That's big &amp; utterly satisfying.</p>

<p>But that's just the glamorous side of the startup world. Behind the scenes it's really a crazy world. The challenges, especially at this scale, are mind-numbing at times. Servers go down at middle of the night. Things pop-up that needed fixing yesterday. When the numbers go up, everything that was just a possible edge-case, becomes a probability, and then shit hits the fan.</p>

<p>That's what all entrepreneurs sign-up for.</p>

<blockquote>"Certainty of death, *small* chance of success... What are we waiting for?" <span class="source">&mdash; Gimli, The Lord of the Rings (JRR Tolkein)</span></blockquote>

<p>One simply doesn't march on Mordor with a random bunch of people. The fellowship was a rather special group of people, so are the group of people who decide to startup. You will hear it echoed throughout the startupverse...</p>

<blockquote>"It's the team!"</blockquote>

<p>Unlike the fellowship, startup people are not the best at what they do. There are abilities that matter more than their skill-set — ability to take a decisions, being able to handle mental pressure, relentlessness, ability to delegate and lead, foresight, instinctiveness and how they fit with everyone else. These traits are honed over the years, in a wide array of experiences. You will notice that most people who work with startups have a variety of interests.</p> 

<p>At Instamojo, we have people who have interests &amp; background in chemical industry, photography, sports, consultancy, banking, retail, marketing, gaming, etc. We even have a game watcher! (I couldn't find a better word for a person who watches video game recordings.)</p>

<p>A lot of experience brings a lot of opinions. We are all opinionated people here. And we care about what we do and build. These two qualities can often result in heated up discussions over seemingly small things. But you wouldn't have that if you did't care.</p>

<p>This startup thing is a very personal experience. You can't have personal experiences with people you are not comfortable with. Humour, in my opinion, is the best measure of comfort and health of a team. There is constant humour at Instamojo. The amount of insider jokes is beyond count. It comes naturally when you're a happy lot. Amount lot of my friends remark that I am the only person they know comes back from work and says he loved it. Perks of being an entrepreneur.</p>

<p>I think 'team' is a very clinical word to use for what I am describing here. Family is a better word. It feels like a family. A Mad Family &amp; I love it.</p>

<blockquote>
"But I Don't want to go among mad people," Alice remarked.<br>
"Oh, you can't help that," said the Cat: "we’re all mad here. I’m mad. You’re mad."<br>
"How do you know I'm mad?" said Alice.<br>
"You must be," said the Cat, or you wouldn't have come here."

<p>This is more of a rambling about how good it feels living a life of your dreams. I hope to write, in detail, about thousands of other learnings and insights that happen every day.</p>
