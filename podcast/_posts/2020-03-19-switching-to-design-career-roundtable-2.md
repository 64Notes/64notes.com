---

This roundtable turned to a conversation between the two — Abhinav Chhikara &amp; Sidharth, since the other guests couldn't make it. We talked about several topics but mostly covered:

### Switching to design career

  - Switching from a non-design industry to design or designer roles
  - Why self-learning is the future of design and why &amp; how you should make your own "path"
  - A framework by Abhinav on how you can track your progress and what you can expect as you start to self-learn design


### Switching from one design specialization to another

  - Why may you want to change — what are some good reasons?
  - Switching from Graphic Design to Product Design
  - Product Designers learning or moving to Motion Design and vice versa


### Generalist vs specialist &amp; multi-disciplinary designers

  - Difference and common things between a generalist and a specialist
  - How requirements and opportunities change as you shift between the two


### Stories
We frequently share our success — let's talk about one story of failure and what you'd learn from it

### Side projects
Abhinav is working on [www.10kdesigners.com](https://www.10kdesigners.com/) — with a goal to help 10,000 new self-taught designers emerge in the industry with a network of industry experts. His [YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/ABNUX)], [uisources.com](https://www.uisources.com/), [booklets.io](https://booklets.io), and many future projects will be under that mother brand.
After several failed attempts at building some apps, I have moved back to blogging, vlogging, speaking at colleges, creating content, &amp; sharing his journey — watching folks from college enter the industry and do well, over the years, and the possibility of being a part of their story is what keeps me going.

## Podcast Transcript
(Edited for clarity)

This is the espisode 4 of the anamorphic podcast, episode number. This is going to be
episode number four. And this is the Roundtable table that has been turned into  like, two folk.,
It's a line now design.

And, uh, so first one I wanted to talk about
is, uh, you know, switching specialization and, uh, a lot of
designers go through that. What happens during that transition and
how should you take up that position and what do you think about,
like, you know, should when you went transition, is it even worth it? Um, yeah. And in what
scenarios? You know, like you, like this is gonna work out and stuff.

**Abhinav:** Yeah. I think transitioning to a UI/UX
designer two scenarios, right? One is you're already in a design
related field, and the second is you're in a field that's not related
to design at all. Like it could be development, it could be tech, or
it could be something totally outside. Like, let's say, you've you've
done your B.Com. Or you're in a business role. Let's say you're in
any type of role and you want to get into design,

**Sidharth:** right

**Abhinav:** I think in both cases, since design, like
this is a thing which I have to keep iteratingwhich is you don't need
a degree for design. Most people don't know that. And, uh, even if
they do know that, they still believe somewhere deep inside that I
don't need a degree. But obviously if I have a degree, I'll be way better than somebody who
doesn't have one. Right. Which is also not true.

**Sidharth:** Right.

**Abhinav:** In the sense that if you look at, the way I
explain it is if you look at India, if you look at the total number
of design colleges, and if you look at what their UX equivalent UX or
UI equivalent batches are, and how many students come out every year,
it's  a few hundred, right?

And these people are not prepared for really  advanced roles either like these
guys, these people know what they've been taught in college. So self
taught is the way forward. You can transition into UI, UX design,
whether you're a graphic designer, a motion designer, you know
something else in design, or even if you're a developer, right.

When you should do it. I think it's a matter of. Or transition when we imagine
it, we imagine it like this clean line where you're this and then you
become this, the way to get into UI, UX design, like any new field.
Actually,  would be to just start where you are already, which is usually we try to look at
it, look at things from a perspective of, I will start it when I get
into design college. Right?

Or when I get a freelance project, maybe then I'll do it. Or when I,
when my company gives me the opportunity to do this kind of project,
then I will get into UI, UX  design.


There's a
lot of graphic designers I know who have UI, UX design teams in their
own company. They really want to do UI, UX, but they're like, when I
get a chance, I'll do it and I'm really interested.

And the
point is, dude, if you are really interested, you should be doing it
already. You have to start where you are at right now.


Start
small, build it up. It's like a snowball effect. Um, if you, the
longer you take to get into it, and if you just keep thinking about
it, it actually gets harder because that's inertia.
 You
start, you know, if you've been thinking about doing it for a year
and you still haven't made any progress, you're going to feel bad.
And that's negative inertia. What's the fear when doing small, small
amounts of stuff? You. Build up, let's say a small portfolio. You do
a few projects, you get some confidence that's positive inertia. So
use intertia [ your advantage], start small and you know, start
where you're at.


That,
that's what my advice would be.

**Sidharth:** Right. And I think I want to, uh, you know,
what, a little bit in sort of answering the question, play devil's
advocate and, um, go to the other side and kind of try to. Um, make
sense of what I've heard from designers, right?

At different stages
of trying to learn design and, um, frankly learn design and, uh, from
developers, especially the switching, like switching from non design
and a lot of them, like it seems like, you know, they are hurdles
along the way.


The first plateau is, uh, should I learn about it? Will I be even good at it? I
am just  interested then, okay, I decide that I'm interested and I
want to get into it. The second question, then that comes is how do I
get into it? You know? Then people will, I obviously, I'll Google, I
look around and try to make sense of it and tons of stuff comes up.


Typically ads from, you know, some institutes will come up and then it looks
even more confusing. Then there's certification and, B, those
certifications make it sound even more official that you are not
officially certified UX designer. You're officially certified
illustrator or graphic designer or whatever you want to pick up.


So then it feels like that if there's an official certification that does
exist, then that's what industry must look for, you know? But if you
try to get into that, then, which Institute is the best Institute?
Right? Is it any different from what I've learned online all these
years? So there's just countless questions after questions after
questions and uncertainty and ambiguity, and there's no well-defined
path, but, right?


Uh, so while I personally take that, as you know, um. The point of like
self-learning is to carve-out your own part, but like, I would love
to hear like, how do you, you know, look at that, like hurdles. How
should one look at those or overcome them and think about it.

**Abhinav:** I think definitely that's, that's the kind
of, I think the kind of world we live in today. We have a
lot of information, righ?


It's not
that people lack information, it's that they have so much
information, they don't know what they should listen to. And that is
definitely sort of big problem. Um, so. The thing that I usually tell
people is that there is no &quot;right path&quot;, but,... Which is
actually, it sounds very simple, but it's actually a big game changer
for people when they actually internalize and figure it out.
 Right.


Which is, if you want to get into, let's say, IIT, there actually is
a right path. There are things that you can do to get in, and if you
do something else, it reduces your chances of getting it right. Um,
it's  probably the same for most things  that you've been exposed to
at the, at the start of your career, which is you think that there is a right path
to do things, but the more experience you get, your realize there is
not.

Right, but right. Because like, I'll give you an example of Uacademy itself.
So at Uacademy, I've hired overall, I would say more than 10
designers, but at any given point of the team. I think I was telling
somebody this during an interview as well, which is we had eight
designers at that time. One of them had gone to design school, one of
them was from architecture, one was a CA before, but one of them was
a computer science engineer.

One was an electrical engineer. Um, you know, it was very diverse. And we had
one or two people who actually went to design school. Right. And what that
just goes to show is. There's no one right path.

Yhat also, that actually makes it way to trickier because now you have all this information and you're telling
me that there's no right path to do it, um, the point is you need
validation.

So as you
move in your journey, you need some checkpoints would say you're
doing well, you're doing well, and usually institutes, help provide
that.


If you are self-learning, set up milestones and checkpoints to keep
checking in to make sure you're not slacking off. So whatever part
you are taking, as long as you're hitting certain checkpoints, you're
good.


And what
the checkpoints are, actually, let's talk about that, right? I would
want your opinion it on this as well.


When
starting out as a designer, what are some checkpoints that you think
they should, you know, uh, hit?

**Sidharth:** I think, uh. It's very subjective, right?
Because what kind of designer you want to become a part.

So, uh, the only common thing we can, of course, the first kind of checklists
you want to build is a technical checklist, right? Let's say you want
to become a graphic designer, then you look at all the skill sets
that you may need for that, and that's where you start from, right?
And over time, as you start learning, your checklist will get more
refined.


You know, no more things you don't know, you will discover more things you
don't understand at all. So, uh, I think that's the technical aspect
of it. But the non technical aspect of, of the checklist will be
around first, um, having certain kinds of moments, you know, because
design is a very, it's taught by experience.


You can read a thousand blogposts and read books about it [] and take
courses. But, doing design is doing design, you know? It's really in
a weird, awkward space in the head. So, um, I think in that
nontechnical checklist for me, they will, would be these couple of
experience. First, have a hope for an experience less than your first
year, and as soon as possible, as soon as you are able to handle it,
uh,  an event where the feedback that completely destroys all your
assumptions, right?


That's the first event I would hope happens with me. The second one that,
that, that I would hope for is when I am able to observe, use the
user using the product I'm building or the design I'm working on. So
that's the moment I would hope for. And that's, that's, I mean.
Especially for folks coming in from like a traditional design school,
it may sound like, Oh, so, aren't we going to do research for like
every project.


So how is that a milestone? But one would be surprised, like by the reality of
that, of what, what happens there. So it was a lot, a lot, a lot of
times you just don't have time for research of, like, just get an
example. Like right now, uh, with COVID-19, uh, is going around and
that has impacted travel industry, including, uh, you know, head out
a lot because people are not traveling around.


And right now what our response is, right as, as a design team of what is
required and what the customers are asking or what they're feeling.
We don't have time to think about  like  Oh, we're going to follow
the process of like, okay, let's go down and start research. You have
the literature you have, you have what you have you need to do with
the information you have at the moment, because information
everywhere is, like,  very limited.Yet.


So there's a lot of real life scenarios where you can't just follow the
book by the process. So, uh, I think hoping for that realization and,
and, uh, you know, is one of the important things, but the most
powerful way that we do experience that is to notice the customer
actually using your product.


And talking about it when, when they don't know, maybe that, I
mean, the way they don't be watched, I mean, they weren't, they got
to know because you gotta have consent because, but at the same time,
they got to be comfortable enough where they don't feel being watched
so you can watch them in their natural habitat.


So I think at least those, what we do and designers should hope for. Yeah.
Or you know, from achieving the technical aspect they achieve, and
the rest is like an artist's journey. You know, you will know that
you're not great at typography. Then you want to get better at that.
You're not great at, uh, you know, uh, let's say colors.


So we're gonna get better at color combination. Like, I suck at colors. At
times, either. I'm really good with colours or I suck at colours.
That's why even my personal website is also all gray. Like that's,
that's what I go for.  but when I'm painting or drawing, like I'm
good with colors, right? Like suddenly, like all of that is so it's
very fluctuating, but I know it's been on my personal checklist and
what progress I'm making that.


Uh, so I think those, that checklist is forever, but yeah, keeping an active
active cyclist is important. And I've been, um, I think that that
idea I've been sharing with a lot of interns as well. Um, the what
you're talking about, like the moment you go into an internship or
join a new job, um, just go in before getting in with a checklist of
what you want to achieve or learn while there and if possible, even
shared it with your, you know, reporting manager, they will be happy
to know like, you know, what kind of projects you are interested in,
what you should be guided towards.


So just that simple idea of just making like 10 bullet points of what you
want to sort of learn. So yeah, I think that's about the checklist to
get into specifics of like, you know, specific kind of checklist.

**Abhinav:** Yeah. I'll also talk about the checklist.

**Sidharth:** Yes.

**Abhinav:** The  way I also tell people is it's hard to
get lost in the depth of things, which is why it's also probably a
good idea to set timelines for certain things, right?

So timeline that I've, that I've told a
couple of people is that if you're getting started in UI, UX design
today, your timeline should look like this. So within the first week,
you should know how to use *Figma*, right?


It only takes a week to learn. It's actually
as simple as that. Within the first month, you should be able to make
a couple of screens and by a couple of screens, I don't mean. Like
just two screens. I mean, you should be able to try making , try
recreating a variety of screens such that you start understanding the
depth of the software, which is what it can do.


So that is within one month. Paralley, you should also start reading about
what are there different things out there, which is breadth  is one,
which is, you know, freelancing.


You have colors, typographic UI design, UX design, mobile versus web. You have
grids, you have so much stuff. And then there's something which is
depth, which is actually getting into how do you actually do this one
thing really well.


So as a
learner you have to go breadth as well as depth. But within your
first month.


First
three months even, you should be exploring a lot of breadth. So
booklets.io, the site that I run, that is mostly about showing
breadth, which is on the site, for example, you will be able to find
snippets of different fields just to understand that there is
something called a, you know, material design out there.


There is
something called illustrations and there are sites where I can get
illustrations or there is something called an eight point grid.
There's something called a 12 column grid, because when you're
starting, you don't know what you don't know and that blankness can
get intimidating, right? So, first three months you understand what
the field is. Within your first six months, get your first project.
This is either a freelance project, it's a full end to end app,
either freelance project. I don't think you'll be able to get an
internship within this, but it is possible. I know folks who've done
it,


Or even
if it's a personal project for your case study, this first project
and your first six months of learning design. Would be an end end
thing, which is, it's not just a couple of screens, it's a whole
system  the user enters here and they do this, they do that, and.
This first project is probably not going to be very great, but it's
going to be something, and this is going to be your first case study
that by month eight or maybe you are doing this parellelly, this will start, this will be the
thing that will sort of be the bedrock of your portfolio.

Which is nominally designers, when they start their portfolio, they have daily
UI on their thing, which is. They're just doing a bunch of
experiments, which is also okay, but having a real case studies is
really good. So this is sort of milestone that I relay, this is sort
of for like the first year, but then at the same time it's tricky
because there is no path, these are milestones, so you might actually
do this a way, faster, you might complete this whole thing and I
truly just three months and that is okay too.


Or it might take you longer based on how much dedication you're actually
giving to transitioning into the UI, UX, it might not be a full time.
Um, effort for you but that's sort of how I would lay it out.

**Sidharth:** I think that that's a wonderful framework for,
uh, people to follow. And that's one question asked like,
countless-ly, do you like, and that sort of talks about the plateau I
was talking about earlier as well.


It also maps out, like in what time should you expect if you give like, you
know, full effort. What you, what can you expect to achieve if you
really focus? And that's, and that's, that's an interesting thing
about design, right? Um, I wouldn't say that, uh, you know, that
there's any barriers to entry to design.


Anyone can learn it, but, uh, that's the, you know, challenge design poses
in front of you as well, that you have to figure out your own path
out, even if you're a, you know, designer with a degree. I'm sure the
 professor and the college will help you figure it out the
syllabus. And you know, how you should think about ending if you give
you mental models.


But the application of design, um, that's something that you have to learn on
by doing. Like that. There's no two ways about it. And there are
folks who are willing to make that effort and see that return, uh,
sort of, you know, climb that plateu to over time. And, uh, I think
that's. You're not an if you want to figure it out.


I think that's a brilliant framework. I love that. So have you put that in,
in, in, in some sort of visual or like

**Abhinav:**  Not yet, but coming soon!


**Sidharth:**  I'm pretty sure, uh, since getting into some specific stuff, you know,
specifically designer, designer transition now. Uh, were you already
working, let's see, started out as a designer and now you're planning
to switch.


And what are the most popular ones I think is, uh, from a graphic designer to
work, you know, what they call a UI UX designer, or just have been a
product. Just designing digital products is what their intent is. So
what, like, why not in your, uh, your experience and your
conversations with all the designers?


Why do designers sort of want to do that? And, uh, what is then a good
reason to do that or is not a good reason. And, like what, what path
would one follow, do you know, sort of obvious.


**Abhinav:** So if you're a graphic designer watching
this, I'm going to speak straight to you, right? And you understand
what I'm talking about.


The day to day of your work is either social media posts. It's
banners, it's emailers, it's collaterals, which is you're making
these collaterals, which you usually at a high frequency, like every,
sometimes every day, sometimes every week you have to keep making
these, and this is actually really fun. When you get started out or
after a point, you sort of hit this sort of saturation where you're
like, I'm doing the same thing. Just
slightly different.


And I'm doing the same thing every day. A lot of
graphic designers don't actually reach this point and they keep
exploring even further. And that is also totally okay. But a lot of
graphic designers sort of reached this point where they're like, is
this all graphic design has to offer?


Um, and when you do reach this point, it can be a sign that you are looking
for something. For an outlet for your creativity that is outside just
social media, posts, banners, and collaterals. And the point is also
that collaterals are usually one off tings. Which followers, similar
brand style versus when you're a UI UX designer, you're creating
systems, which is sort of a big leg up from just designing
collaterals because now you have to think at a higher level.


So that is actually a big challenge for creativity because it requires you to
think of more variables running together at the same time. So as a
graphic designer, if that's the position you're in today. Switching
to UI. UX design is actually a very viable thing for you, and it's
going to be super simple for you because the most challenging thing,
which is figuring out tools or figuring out what a design process
typically looks like, you already have some idea of that.


It's just that intro, designing posters, let's say, you're designing screens.
Now, as when designing a poster there are certain things that go with
it, which is the kind of colors you can use. The, let's say, the grid
systems for posters, the kind of paper you print it on. Now these are
constraints to your design for screens that are other constraints,
which is, is this iOS or Android?


Um, what part of the flow is it? And what's the purpose is that, uh, you know,
click-through rate you've to think about, so you are just getting
used to designing. But for a new medium, this medium now is a digital
screens.

So as a graphic designer, you're in a very good position. Start figuring out
how you can start applying your creativity to this new medium.


**Sidharth:** Yeah, I think, uh, love that. Love that answer.
And I completely agree with it. So I'm just going to extend from
where you left off and, um. And picking up from, you know, different
medium. That's where I see most of the graphic designers trying to
switch to digital design or digital products. Um, that's where they
mostly fall off and not understanding that the aesthetic sense changes. Right?


So following a similar path of trying
to recreate the UI to understand, to get a better sense of pattern
and since you're already a designer, you will pick up those patterns.
Right. What are the sensibilities of a digital product and what other
sensibilities of an OS and a platform you're designing for. Is it web? Is it Android? Is it iOS?


Is it, what platform are you designing for? And what kind of app
you're designing for. You will also start to notice the kind of
aesthetics, let's say, a utility app has vs, let's say, a game has,
and those are very two different kinds of aesthetics. You know,
you will follow as a designer.


So sort of following the same path
really helps, uh, to pick up on the sensibilities. And, uh, another
thing I think that I want to really emphasize is the way we think
about, uh, design. When we are a graphic designer is like the kind of
interaction and distance people are usually used to. Um, is
very different,


I mean, apart from social media posts because they,
they're consumed on mobile phone, but, uh, even there, you're trying
to get through a click through rate and you, you know, your area of
influence is limited and you don't think about something called
States, you know, that's going to be another platform. Uh, and
that's already another pitfall where you're gonna fall off.


Because yeah, we are used to designing social media and designing creatives
for that, we just put out one creative saying, this is what it is.
You know, a sale  this is the coupon if you want to follow. But if
you were designing that digitally. Um, as a template, as a system,
you know, thing you thinking about systems, then you will need to
design how many characters can this line actually hold? How big
can that be? Can you put like currency-off or precentage-off? And
those kinds of elements, right?


So when you start to think about how
to templatize, you know, some of your designs, you will sort of start
to get an idea of States that even States what States are. For
example, let's say you go to WhatsApp.
 right?
uh, what does a contact with whom you do have chats look like versus
with whom you've do not have chats. So those are two different States
of the same element, but a thing you're designing.

So that is another
thing that I have noticed personally, like  designe trying to switch
over like have that aha moment.
 Like, Oh.


So that's what I was missing, you know, like that's when I was, there
was a lot of back and forth and back and forth that was happening.
And, and typography, right? Those type-scales practiced in like, uh,
you know, when you're creating or doing print work or social media
and the type skill practice.


Like when
doing product design, you know, designing for digital media. It's,
it's, it's very, very different on that platform. So, yeah, I think
that's specifically about from graphic designers to UI, UX designers.
And then I think, uh, moving on to like a lot of UI, UX designers and
are now getting interested in motion design, you know, uh, and what's
up with that?


And we
also didn't talk about, I think we, it's important to talk about why,
uh, you know, graphic designers are wanting to switch to product
design in your observation, why do they want to switch.

**Abhinav:** I think it just, that graphic design can get
boring for a lot of graphic designers, which is illustrators I've
seen actually usually are really happy with illustration illustrating
because there's just so much of
 from my
opinion, there's so much depth to explore there. But in most, in a
lot of companies, graphic design only means like two or three things,
right? And that can get very static. But I think the biggest reason
is that you get bored of applying your creativity this way. And now
you wanna apply it this way.

**Sidharth:** Right.

**Abhinav:** And then other reason then could also be
money.

 UI, UX
designers, on an average, make a lot more money than graphic
designers.

**Sidharth:** Right.

**Abhinav:** Um, so that also can be a big motivating
factor.

**Sidharth:** Right. And another trend I've seen I think is
that graphic designers, if they want to make the same amount of
money, they do well off to be freelancing and consulting.


But to
run that sort of show, is it not, not everybody's cup of tea because
it's, it's, it's really difficult to keep that clients flowing,
follow up and you know, keep the deadlines yourself at times you need
the,like, you do function better in, you know, team sort of
environment and that can get really difficult.


Speaking of which, uh, you know, you pointed on an interesting part that can
get boring. And that's why I think, uh, at Headout, especially in our
discussions of talking about the structure of the team, uh, this is
the point, uh, as well that came up and that's where we were very
specific about not having a graphic design team, but
a visual communication design team, which is broad enough to cover a
lot of, uh,  digital and non-digital aspects of, uh, all sorts of
communication, including things like iconography is visual
communication.


That's sort of like, becomes a shared sort of,
you know, area. Of like your work goes and becomes like the size of
icon here vs there, I can see you're involved in a lot of layers, so
they know we have a bunch of interns, but like if you're watching
this video and if you are interested in visual communication, it
should totally apply because we are looking for folks who are
interested in visual communication.


Shameless
plug hashtag.

**Abhinav:** That's very interesting because for us, what
we decided was to actually splits the team.  spread the team way
before it grew. So

 at some
point it was eight people on the UI, UX team and eight people on
graphic design. But we actually split way earlier where it was about
two and two or three and three.


And one
of the reasons we did it was just that the pace of work was so
different, which is. Um, the people who are doing graphics, had to do
like two or three things every single day, and then two or three
different things the next day. When did this was emails, banner ads,
social media versus for product designers.


They were
doing things on a slower timescale, which is maybe in a week, you
think about this one problem, what does bigger project that you're
working on, which is like, what, two or three weeks maybe.

**Sidharth:** Right.

**Abhinav:** Um, so we did that and then that did cause
some problems initially when we split it, which is like coordination
and then, um, you know, designers like hanging out with other
designers. You'll split the teams now and there's less people you can
hang out with.

But over
time what happened was when the teams grew in size, it actually
became all okay because then the graphic design team started looking
like. There are people who were doing just  animation, like just
motion design. There were people who are doing just, let's say, a lot
of design ops work, which is banners and ads kind of stuff. They got
much closer with the YouTube team, which was making videos. Right.


Um, because then they started making graphics for a lot of videos.
Only other YouTube team used to  have difficulty pulling them away
from, you know, the product team.

**Sidharth:** Right.

**Abhinav:** And then they got really close with the
content teams. They got really close with the Academy teams. So
eventually that sort of worked out.

**Sidharth:** Hey, that's, that's kind of a nice idea. I
think I'm going to try some of that serendipity again, to set that up
 and the environment for that to happen as an experiment, because
that makes complete sense.


You know,
the better sense they have of the kind of content there's going in
and the kind of, you know, who are the people who are using their
design and why they really want and getting them closer to, uh, that
sort of feeling. And an interesting thing that is, I mean, we do have
that sort of split as well.
 Um, I
mean, there are designers are solely focused on visual
communication., but again, the split is between like, you know,
mentally or visual communication. Uh, which does involve a lot of
digital, you know, uh, product design work or let's say a lot of, uh,
a lot of work that overlaps multiple mediums, right? um, which will
be used from a social media creative.


And even
with social media creative. Now we are trying to approach, because
the kind of, you know, multiple languages, etc. etc.  Kind of
experiment that we have to run. We are trying to, uh, approach that
with the design system point of view as well. When after greeting X
number of creatives, we try to create a system out of it and see if
that can be standardized. And then see that humans only need to
review for quality standards
 once in a
while and sort of like sitting down and creating, just removing the
redundancy and manual effort, instead the graphic designers or let's
say the visual communication designers, in our case are now thinking
about what alternate styles would they experiment with. Yeah. Right.
Oh, how could they, what would they actually test to see whether this
works?


So you
start asking questions from their designs and you know, what data
they are looking at and suddenly going from looking at it from that
trajectory instead of just, you know, being in that circle, it's kind
of very, it's very difficult because the requirements [ it comes
to] visual communication are always, always so unique. Like this
banner
 never,
ever looks like that, but banner, but over time you can roughly
develop uh, you know, a rough sense of things, a starting point, or
at least, which then can be worked on [ a system]


**Abhinav:** As a design manager, it's really hard to give
feedback to graphic design teams as well as product design. Cause for
product design, the kind of feedback you need to give us more
systemic, maybe a longer term thing because that timelines are bigger
versus for graphic design feedback is now you need to do this today.


**Sidharth:** We had to post this like yesterday. That's
always the case.

**Abhinav:** Yeah. And then also another thing that helped
for us was moving to *Figma*. Which is initially since the graphic
design team was all using illustrator, um, there was complete, um,
there was complete disconnect where we didn't know what they were
working on, but once they actually moved to *Figma*, they were like,
this is so much better than illustrator.
That's
when they start.


And that's when we started having closer
communication, even though we sat apart. Because you are now using
the same tool. And that's when they started exploring a lot of design
systems. Like there was this one thing where we had to generate like
a thousand posters with a person's name with data, how many minutes
they've watched and things like that.


And since
they were on *Figma* they used a  plugin connected into to Google
sheets and just ran this.

**Sidharth:** On nice!

**Abhinav:** That's something that would have been much
harder if they
were not thinking from a, you know, system's perspective.

**Sidharth:** Hey, I need that plugin because we  have very
similiar requirements. You're going to link me up and I'm going to
add the link in the description as well, because I'm pretty sure
other folks are looking for that as well.


Try out
the next week. Let's see. And uh, yeah. Moving onto like the next
kind of specification I think was motion. Moving to motion design,
you know, like have you observed, that has worked out and where can
one start exploring.


**Abhinav:** So I think with motion design, there's
usually two types of motion design that you're thinking about if you
want to get into it.


One is
motion design in apps, which is, let's say, um, let's say
micro-interactions button. Stapes, um, mostly microinteraction.
That's the category I would put it in. And the second type is actual.
Motion graphics, which is you want something where there's a bird
flying with its wings, right? It's not just a search-bar expanding.


So for
both of these things, firstly should, it helps me very clear which
one you want to go into.


It's
totally different types of motion graphics. Um, mostly I, if you
don't want to get into the thing where it's birds, but it's actual
motion graphics where it's like physics, you have to consider the
tool of your choices after effects.


That's
the only tool you have to use versus if you actually want to get into
motion graphics. I mean, if you want to get into motion for product
design, then you can actually just use principle, protopie, and
[Figma's Smart Animate](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039818874-Create-Advanced-Animations-with-Smart-Animate). Um, this lets you create very simple
compositions where you're like state a, state B, and when it goes
from here to here and animate it like this, um, so.


Knowingthat these are two categories is actually really helpful. Personally,
me, I only know the, I only know one of those categories, which is my
micro-interactions. I have no idea how after effects works. I've
actually never used it, but that's what I would tell people. Yeah.

**Sidharth:** Yeah. So, uh, it's funny because, um, my
introduction to After Effects happened when I was exploring  film
making, and that's when I learned from premiere pro as well. I think
I was a teenager.

So, uh,
that time I used it for like, you know, the bird-flying kind of time,
try to use it for that. I was interested in trees that when, uh, my
father even, I think I remember enrolled me in to some animation
course, which I never went to for a single day. I just, I don't know.
This didn't come to me like, naturally.


But, uh,
years later. Like now to see sort of like even people who weren
traditionally motion design of that sort like animation, which is
typically like 2D or even 3D animation where you would use something
like Maya or Zbrush, uh, them trying to sort of think about, now we
see them entering the product design world as well.

With
eBay, you see these these 3D renders instead of illustrations, which
were there earlier. And, uh, now you see people doing complex []
animation on something like, uh, after effects as well. Did I, uh,
but I think anyone who wants to do either one, the first principle
that one should understand is how shapes and, uh, you know, motion
through time actually works and what, what stories are shaps tell,
over time, when you manipulate them over time. Right?


And there are some great filmmakers who have done, uh, you know,
fantastic documentaries online on that. And at least that's been my
inspiration, right? Like, not that I've done like a lot of product
design [] work. But my framework of looking at them, it has
always been in that language. Even when we were trying to design the,
you know, when we were setting the nomenclature for a design system
on how we want to infuse  animation on that table, it was all based
on that kind of like, you know, entry, uh, stage exit.


So, uh,
it, it just so natural to talk about what's happening in the screen
that a component is entering the screen. What's going to happen now?


It's on the stage, what's happening there. Like, what can it do? And
when it, how does the next exit the stage as well? So it gives you a
complete framework on how to think about, uh, you know, what you're
looking at on the screen in completely different way.


And it
falls in very naturally with sort of systemic thinking from our point
of view, where you can, um, build complete logic of how this would
function.  Build an end-toend-logic and have it completely like, you
know, covered in terms of coverage of, of all the situations that you
can go in. Because think about designing for one video is very
different when you're designing a state, let's change in a card size,
but this is somebody that has done it because you're no idea, uh,
what was in that card. Right?


Oh, so if it's colored image, how does it blur?  If it text, how
does, when does it, does the text  disappear? Does it blow
up with the card? Like there's a lot of things that you can, you will
need to consider in the right. And, um, just understanding basics of
animation or truly animation traditional or filmmaking really, really
helps you understand and gives you a framework of, you know, how to
sort of think about a product animation or just digital animation or
micro-interactions.


**Abhinav:** I think even between the two, like between
motion graphics and motion in UI design with motion graphics, your
output is going to be a video. Right? That's usually not great for.
Micro interactions versus what do you actually want is motion in UI.
Your output is actually a prototype where you can play around with
it, and here you can actually see that as your finger moves up, the
animation is slowly happening, so it's not just time.


Then
there's also like this action involved with it.

**Sidharth:** Right. Right.

**Abhinav:** And then there's this, there's a really good
quote that says that. In your Figma file or you have screen A and
screen B, but at 60 FPS, there are 60 States that you need to design
between that screen A and screen B. That's the importance of a motion
UI design, which is users don't look at it as screen one and screen
two.


They look
at it as one continuous space where things just happen.

**Sidharth:** Yeah. I think that that sort of sets the stage
of the language when starting to think about like what is happening
on the street. And I think I was reading this in Taruna Manchanda's
blogpost about Swiggy Pop, one of the favorite lines of when I'm
getting the pieces "Customer ko kya dikhega?" [ will
the customers see].


So I
think that's a very good framework to sort of start looking at motion
design and, well, I mean, one would say like, that's what designers
do, but no, like, you know, at time you're designing things that
you've even []. But motion design is really about what people
will continuously see.


Uh, you
know, as a factor. There's no . Like we seem them, I think we were
talking about in our design case study that we're doing on your time,
that uh, uh, that months exist in our head. The time runs continuous,
so you can just design logic a month in the, at times in universe as
well unit. Um, you can break it down like that.


And the
same way time, you know, we divide two screens, but you can just cut
it out like that because time is continious, you know. The device
still exist. The users still exist as the screen is like an, as an
experience designer, the motion designer, you have to worry about
what happens. And I think it started with the skeletal animation
loading animations where those kinds of things are coming in.


But yeah,
I think that was what we have moved forward into really thinking
about. You know how to use motion as a form of communication.


 I think
it's a good time to, a natural thing to move into this. The next big
question, which was around multi-disciplinary designers, you know,
and how, uh, what is that experience around I'll like, uh, does that
eventually happen?


Is it
inevitable? Oh, do you have to make it happen? And how is it, is
there an event and what does it even mean to be disciplining
designers? Um, and most of us emerging

**Abhinav:** I'dsay say as a designer, you'd probably
identify with one of two types. You're either a generalist audio
specialist. Most people are actually, every single person is either a
generalist or a specialist.


And the
differences here now as specialists, for example, would be somebody
who's really good at, let's say, illustrations, really good at motion
design, really good at UX research. I'm really good at, let's say,
visual design, really good at prototyping. But they don't do anything
else. They only do the thing that they're really good at and
everything else.


They
either don't know or they never do it. That's what a specialist is.
Agenda list to somebody who's sort of like a full stack designer
where you know all of these parts. Now, of course, even here you
might have your strengths and your weaknesses, but in every single
project you end up doing all the steps in world.
 Now,
depending on whether you're a generalist suspecialist. The kind of
stuff you do changes wildly or based on the kind of stuff you want to
do, you should make up your mind which of the two you want to become.
Because for freelance work, if you want to be a freelancer, you
cannot be a specialist. You need to be a generalist, which people are
not going to, they're not going to hire you to just do.
 What
actually for some specialists, I agree. Let's say illustration,

**Sidharth:** I was gonna say that.

**Abhinav:** You can't just do wire frames, for example.
You can't just do low fidelity and research and be like, tha's it.
Freelance usually requires you to do like the full app or the full
feature, or even at
startups, usually early stage or early upto mid-stage.


They
usually hire more generalists than specialists, and only when the
team starts scaling, which is like beyond, let's say, when you reach
eight to 10 people, that's when you start hiring specialists. So
based on the kind of work you want to be doing, you should make up
your mind whether you want to be a generalist or a specialist.


Um, of
course, most designers I've good at multiple things. But the point of
a generalist or specialist is you want to do all of those things or
do you want to just do one of those things?

**Sidharth:** I think I love, I love that framework and that
as well and completely agree with that. Um, this one to cut a
different way, which is, um, you know how I view it, like even to the
path to being a specialist.


Is, uh,
laid down with being a lot of generalist a lot of times in, you know,
sort of. The only difference, therefore, in what we perceive to be
generalists and specialists must be that, uh, your choice and, you
know, how narrow do you cost your. You know, uh, net in sort of speak
on what you want to learn. So if you just get heavily been done,
okay.


I want to
like really act as generalist does this talking about graphic design,
right? So then you have to learn about color, type, size of different
kind of mediums, right? So you'll have to be a generalist of a
specialist a lot of times and the in there for it in a larger,
broader sense, being a generalist for just be eventually be a
specialist, you know, in, in something like a graphic design.


Um, w and
the, and the, and the same applies for like, you know, um, UX
researchers who are consultants. It's that far and few, but, uh, I
mean, they, they exactly deliver that at times of these, all they do
is just delivered research and you know, findings of what they've
done and their agencies, the whom, companies I for that.


But that
bar is set really high that you have to be a really strong specialist
and that thing you're talking about, or freelancer expecting and
end-to-end stuff, all the supplies it there. You can just interview
people and we're like, yeah, I spoke to people. Now where's the
report? I mean, it doesn't work that way.
 Right?


It
won't function. So, uh, so there are those sorts of layers, you know,
like as you good as the scale increases, like, uh, you know, uh, in
the adding the same point talk, you're talking about just turning it
around, none of the team, but of the problem you're looking at. That
also warrants adding more specialists and you know, adding more.
Usually, the two are related because as your company and the problems
increases, you will add.


That's
when you will add people to the team. Um, but that's sort of what
causes that to happen because let's say you're working in a video a
lot, right? Your company works in video a lot. Then eventually you
will start to work towards designers who sort of have done that work
and sort of specialize in that or interested in that sort of.
 []
naturally  tends to happen, but to get there I think is important.
You have to realize that you have, if you do decide to be a
generalist, then realize that you will completely change domains. Uh,
you know, as you're working on, as you were talking about going from
graphic design person doing the product design, that's sort of a
minor of a generalist.


And then
being specialist is doing the same sort of thing, but in a very
narrow window. Right. And getting like the same and that
width-vs-depth sort of thing. You know, that sort of thing we were
talking about earlier that you see variety it first, you know. If you
like variety. then maybe being a generalist for you is a good idea.


Either
know something about everything.


Are you
go  the other way where you know everything about something. So
that's sort of the two ways you can go about it. And honestly
speaking like. Naturally, you will find yourself being in both and,
but what we're talking about here is what does 90% of your time at
work or in your work goes into like is it switching context a lot of
times and then your job, does it require to me generalist or does it
go any deeper into the same problem that you're looking at? Right?
Then your mind requires you to be very heavy specialist.

**Abhinav:** think in general there are, I mean, usually
when people talk about generalist and specialists, they don't talk
about it within design. They talk about it in terms of, I can do
marketing development as well as this thing,

 but if
you're talking just about design, also, the number of jobs, like this
is something that.


If you're
listening right now, you can quickly open a new tab and go to LinkedIn, go to jobs. So it's for product designer, UI designer, UX
designer. You're going to find a few thousand results. You want to
find 3000 to 6,000 job listings. What's the search for things like
motion designer, illustrator, a UX copywriter.


You're
going to find a few hundred jobs, right? I did this before. I did
this just today, actually preparing for our round table, but. That's
a similar scene of freelancing as well, which is more, there'll be
more people looking for general design work, less of people looking
for very specific.


So that's something worth thinking about. Like you
can interpret that in many different ways actually.


**Sidharth:** Yeah. I think that that's a very good picture
of the economics of the market as it exists and that the more you can
sort of cover in the project and the less, uh, you know, that those,
those sort of companies are more. Or that sort of work is more out
there in market, then people who exactly know what they want from you
and they've got the rest of it figured out and themselves.
 Those are
far and few. Right. So, um, I think that that's very, well, I think
that those are a lot of nice frameworks for, to look at that, uh, you
know, it is pretty designer point of view and coming to now, um, you
know.

 Talking
about some moments, emotional moments of being a designer. Uh, I
think I especially wanted to cover starting with like failure, like
one failure that that led you felt in the dark, so to speak.
 Right.
And, um, yeah, I mean, you get to pick whichever one you want. Um,

**Abhinav:** I talk about some of my solo experience
there. There've been about one or two times where I've had.


I've had real issues doing longterm freelance projects. Right. And this is
something that I only realized much later, which is, there was this
one time where I was doing the design project where there was a
website that needed to be designed, the branding that needed to be
done.

Um, and
then there was a Mac app that needed a redesign. Um, so I of course,
started with the branding, did a few concepts, then moved onto the
website. Now even in a website, there's the homepage, which is most
important. And then there's all other pages. So I ended up doing the
homepage and then, uh, started a little bit on the Mac app design.


And then
with then this, like, this itself took two months. And this was
supposed to be. All right, this was supposed to be like a one month
project or something. And I, of course, I didn't estimate really
well, but then the project actually ended up going really badly. Um,
sd like we germinated midway. I only got paid like maybe the,


I think we settled on like 30, 40% of the total thing.


And then
I was just like, what a failure. Like that was a really big failure
for me because, um. It was a really good project. So there was a lot
of scope to do something very, very cool. But then in hindsight,
right, the my learnings, my takeaways from that was me personally, I
am, I find really hard to do longterm projects where I'm doing the
same thing over and over.


So I had
an Uacademy, for example, as the head of design. This was actually
really good because I got to do a lot of different things. Designers
are working on a lot of different projects, a lot of different.
Feedback to be given, and then there's things to handle which just
keep getting thrown at you. Like I'm really good in that kind of
environment, but I realize I'm not good at an environment where I
have to do the same thing over a long period of time.


**Sidharth:** Right.


**Abhinav:** So how, how I would've done it differently is
probably in sort of taking up all three of these things, I would have
said, okay, I'm only going to do your homepage, and as part of this,
I will lose some branding concepts that you can then expand on. But.
What I, I have a big problem saying no to things.
 It bitten
me in the ass before.

**Sidharth:** Yeah. Very interesting. I think that makes me
want to share like to differently was a failure and uh, one that's
sort of like leads to pain and one that's sort of leads to like
eventual success.


The first
one, when I was running this UX design agency with my co founder, we
had this.


Big ass
client, like very popular brand. And uh, we were working for them
trying to develop this website and we would like day and night across
the cities with a remote team. So we worked like upwards of about two
to three months. One night, like they will send a check list of a
heavy list with like 25 points points, bullet points of changes.


We'll do
that. And then they would change their mind. And that went on for
like three months and we really wanted to do it because we were like,
how can we not get it right, right? Like ego and be, uh, we were
like, it's a big really big client. Like if you're able to pull it
off and they were paying a shit really bad money.


Like, I
mean. The little money then you would expect except from anyone. And
that's what is true about most brands because they are bigger brands.
They pay far less. They try to negotiate more. And we really wanted
to do it, uh, because, uh, you know, it was. A big brand and we
wanted that on a portfolio. So in the end we just finally gave up
because they were like over after three months of doing iterations.

Then they
started delaying on us.Like they would start dealing feedback for a
week and no, we're not sure about the project. So doing after doing
like three months of iterations. And we broke our own rule, like
guide the client through iteration, but we were like, okay, they are
like a big company, like, you know, they.


Would
know, would they even know what they're doing? But turns out they
didn't know shit or they didn't know what they were looking for. And
by looking at so many choices, they got even more confused, which is
typically what happens. And it's that sort of role, it's very
important for you to guide the client.


So that
was once sort of failure, which just we just quit and we was just
like, forget about it. Like, forget the money for getting declined.
It's over. So that ended in, in sorrow.


Another
sort of failure happened when, um, you know, we, me and the product
manager I was working with back then. We sort of working on our
homepage and we did our like fancy stuff.


We went
through our keyword research, this and that, and we came up with a
nice new concept for the homepage and how it will extend to different
landing pages and how late. You know, like it was, it was really
cool, like what we were up to. But then this new product manager
comes in who's been like talking to customers like for a month and he
rips it apart in a meeting.


Like he rips it apart. Like. Who wants to know this? No one cares. I just
want to know like this, this, this, like give me this one, two, three
item. I haven't got time for anything else in this handling down
customer's perspective.


And in between, like the product manager who was working with me, he got
like a little upset. But I was like, let's, let's hear him out.


And that's the first time I, I felt what accepting feedback feels like. I
think consciously, because earlier there was always a layer of like,
you know, like, okay, this is about the work I've done. But I think
this is the time the feedback was so brutal, right? And so on point
that there was no way for me to, even for a moment to feel conscious
and it all became about the customer.


And I just wanted to hear somebody. If there's ranting and the rant felt
like the rant of the customer because that's what I, I have heard the
kind of things when I went and spoke with the customers.


So I think
that eventually led us to completely  changing the homepages of
throwing everything away, starting with scratch and developing
something that became like a foundation for like, you know, even literally followed till today for
the homepage. So that, that was sort of like a failure,  I would say,
that led to like a much bigger success. And, uh, that's, that's, I, I
wish it had happened more often for sure.


I think
the last one I want and I really want to talk about is what projects
you're working on and why. And this could be like about side
projects. I mean, for me it may be around side  projects. But for
you, the side projects are the main projects. So what are you working
on?


**Abhinav:** So let me give some context to build up the
way, which is, I want to talk about.


One of
the moments of success that I went through that really changed my
perspective. Um, and this was when I first made money on the internet
to something I . So this was somewhere around a couple of years back
maybe, I would say it was 2014 or 2016 probably. Uh, and the thing
that I did was I made this online course on principle.


Uh, it
was called. It's still out there. You can search it. So if you search
for  &quot;Principal for Mac&quot;, one of my medium articles is one
of the top results, and at the bottom you'll find a link to the
ebook. But this was a sort of like an ebook that I'd made. It's like
an online course about how to learn principle from act, and it's
called a designer's guide to motion in a app design.


Um, so it
talks about some of the principles of motion or what you should
consider States, things like that. And then it gets into how do you
actually make these things with principles. So I made this, it took
me about a month to make the whole thing, or it not very video heavy.
It's more text with visuals heavy.


Uh, and I
did very little promotion for it, looking in hindsight compared to
what I'm doing now, but soft.


But. It's made
a few thousand dollars so it's made about four or $5,000 so far. And
like within the first few days, it made about a thousand dollars and
that was actually a big shift for me because I knew I had wanted to
do something, which is like new stuff.


But to me it always look like doing new stuff. Always looked like doing a
startup, which is a raising money for it  going after this
crazy huge problem, which is like. I want to do food delivery. I want
to do eCommerce and something like this, which was as niche as you
know, using principle to make animations in your app made me a couple
thousand dollars.


So that
was a big shift for me. Um, and I always knew I could do it. It's
just that I'd never proven it. I know, and I've seen people do it as
well with different fields, but never proven it to myself. But so
once I had done this, then I realized that was the value of side
projects, which is I think a lot of designers look at site projects
as freelance projects.


Firstly, freelance projects, they're not side projects. It is your hard doing
stuff on the side. But. When I say side projects was it's just side
hustle. Yeah. But side projects or something that you're doing on the
side, which is your own thing.


So today the
kind of projects I'm working on, I've basically used that sort of
formula, which I first figured out in 2016 applied to a lot of
projects.


So now
all my side projects are actually now my main projects and they all
make money.


So now some
of the projects I'm working on. The way I describe this best is, um,
at the top level, it's 10K designers.com. Uh, that's the overall
umbrella company, which all these products fall under as that's the
brand.


Yeah. Uh, the idea of 10k designers is that I want to create 10,000 new
designers, not just by myself
 but through
this whole network to all the people who are going to be involved. So
even you, for example, so that you are part of this.


And 10K designers, because you're going to take a big chunk of that away from
me. And the
main reason was that I know design schools are not producing enough
designers. The future of design is self-taught designers. And now the
products I have under this UI sources is number one. That's basically
a design repository site. Find micro interactions. Uh, so let's say
you're working on a.


You want
to find some onboarding screen? Do you want to find gamification? You
want to see examples of how different apps do different patterns. You
can sort of use UI sources to figure it out. That's probably the
biggest right now. So it does about 150,000 monthly sessions. Um, so
that's the biggest. The second thing is the YouTube channel.
 Of
course. Um. You will find me in the me in one of the comments below
so you can,
 yeah. And
then, uh, then booklet.io is something I launched very recently. Uh,
and one of the reasons I did that was the YouTube channel people are
learning design through it.



Um, UI sources a little bit more
advanced. Most typically don't understand what to do with it. Open
book booklets as a way. To learn the breadth of design, which is you
want to understand a little bit about pricing.


You want
to understand branding, freelancing, graphic design, UI web mindset
process. So it's about small bite sized content. Um, then you can
check out. So that just launched, um, maybe a few weeks back. I'm
waiting to see how that acts up. Uh, and then there's a podcast
coming up as well.

**Sidharth:** Finally

**Abhinav:** yes. Finally. So this
is going to be sometime this month that it comes out. Uh, it's called
whiteboard God, FM . Um, so we'll talk about that in the future.

**Sidharth:** Yeah.

**Abhinav:** Okay. These I've gotten free. And then of
course, there's a separate thing of projects that I'm not ready to
talk about yet, which is still under 10 K designers, Sanford,
slightly outside it.


But that'll be revelaed over time. Yeah.

**Sidharth:** So we have just a perfect teaser, just the
perfect, and well practiced teaser, uh, uh, uh, love that show. Or
you should be in showbiz. already are.. Uh, yeah. So I didn't, I
didn't do, uh, you know, uh, what
projects I am working on, what site projects I am working on.


Um, I
think the blogging earlier, for the longest time, just laying down a
foundation of how I came about it was my failed attempts. It's trying
to create multiple apps. Some for myself. Which were a little too
complex either, or like I just didn't get enough time to focus on
them because there's too many, many abstraction layers when you're
trying to build an app. Including backend, frontend, writing code and
design into this too many layers to crossovers.


Um, so
that, that's sort of like went on for like, I don't know, about two,
three years. And I tried to make multiple apps. I used some for a bit
after making them, but like abandoned later on because there were
other tools, like something I like Notion came up where building
something quick, even a functionality or something like airtable
where it's really quick so that that's sort of faded away.


Uh, but
meanwhile, what I did realize that a lot of write ups and you know,
stuff that I'd done earlier was circling back in multiple ways. And
the folks that had gone to college to speak to you, I keep getting
invited to speak. So, uh, I got one to one college and a bunch of
them started reaching out, now, from the side of industry.


So that
sort of is very nice to know that, you know, some people did make
that move in multiple ways. And are doing well now in what they're
trying to learn. So that sort of becomes a motivational push and you
realize, Oh, there is value to what you can, you know, putting your
story out there. And, uh, just, just being in public and learning
what you're learning and, you know, talking to sharing your work out
there in public.


And so
over time, I think just documenting work and helping other people
document their own work and their own ideas. Sort of just looking at
this in a, in a way, uh,  has like now put me on to treating my
YouTube as a side project, right. Uh, or treating, uh, the kind of
experiments I want to do. One tech talk as a side project.


The kind
of news I just started a newsletter and podcast that's also like, you
know, massive side-project that will eventually evolve and just sort
of those. uh, and beauty is you're now the connect very well with the
work because they overlap with what I do. Is what I talk about and
you know, what I discuss what other people do is what I discuss with
them.


But I, in
finding that sort of alignment in goals, was there something that was
fascinating. And then like you said, like there are always other side
projects that you're always working on or thinking about that. In not
already reveal or talk about yet. But there's one that I really wish
to eventually get down to building, which is just a resource site for
students, especially at the end of all the talks I want.


I want to
give out the URL as a CTA, as a call to action as a CTA. Um, that
just has a lot of list of various aspects. You know, different, uh,
things that you, mental models that you should pick up in life. Like,
let's talk about personal finance. Let's talk about this. And instead
of me creating or  some of it honestly, like, let's talk about
designer product.


I will be
grading, linking up for my content as well, but just linking to
articles, videos, films, resources, that sort of like, cover, uh, you
know. Sort of helped me think about, I'll get through that. Like
let's say if I learned double entry accounting, where did I learn
that? Just sort of like building a personal resource site, which I
think will be a fun project.


I haven't
gotten started that yet, but I have drawn just like I ended up doing
diagrams multiple times, trying to disect and bisect it in different
ways. Nice. Yeah. Why I do it is, yeah. Again, coming back to seeing
that value. You know, uh, of seeing those stories of, uh, being part
of somebody as a story, but, uh, you know, getting out, being part of
an important, important time in their life when they were trying to
take that decision.


And, um,
having any influence at all, in any help at all in people trying to
come to  become designers, trying to become whoever they are, like,
whatever. That's, they should be managing that for the longest time.
Even like 10 years ago, that was my agenda - like become what you
want to become. And even now that is the agenda, like all these side
projects reolve around.


So yeah,
that's what the second part is I'm working on. Yeah,

**Abhinav:** you have to close the loop. It's almost like,
you know, in the beginning of the episode we talked about there's so
many pathsts out there is no correct path.


And I
think the. I think the best part, like each, each of us, we are going
down our own paths, so we
technically are the parks. We're like these living pots that we can
actually look up to because it's had an effect on me as well.


I don't personally think I can do something, but then I see somebody
else, a friend of mine who's doing the exact same thing.


It sort of motivates me, which is like if he can do it, of course I can do it
as well. So the best way to actually find paths is to find somebody
who's just like yourself, who's doing things you want to do, and then
backtrack from there and figure out, okay, where am I right now and
where do I want to go?


**Sidharth:** Yeah. And I love that. I think that that's,
that's the best closing line we can have. And that sort of summarizes
all sorts of things we talked about. Um, make some design of things
or make some engineer friends of they get whatever you're playing to
become most likely designer if you're watching this. So, I mean,
designer friends, meet people who do that sort of work and see what
happens.


Awesome. And that, that was a wrap.
