It’s good to see so many businesses becoming aware of quality branding. They are aware of what they are putting out there and what customers are experiencing.

Also it is funny to see so many new business spending a lot on graphics, design aka <em>‘Branding with a capital B’</em> (I mean nice logo and all).<!--more-->

Branding is really not about that. <a title="Branding is about what the customer experiences about you" href="http://www.64notes.com/building-perfect-brand">Branding is about what the customer experiences about you</a>. How they feel about you. Everything else is just to remind him of that.

I like to call cool graphics and logo and stuff <em>‘Brand Awareness’</em> (<em>or Branding with a capital B</em>). It’s there to remind them how it feels to eat at KFC, use Apple products and all.

Don’t you just carve for a good Zinger when you see KFC logo?

Without all that experience and service the logos and colors are meaningless.

Brand awareness supports brand not create it. Focus more on building your brand, awareness comes later.
