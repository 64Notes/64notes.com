Hi! I am <strong>King Sidharth</strong> and this is a <strong>collection of my notes &amp; essays on entrepreneurship, startups, business and design as an entrepreneur</strong>.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>I am 21 - an <a href="https://www.instamojo.com">entrepreneur</a>, <a href="/design">designer</a>, artist and a <a href=/speaking>public speaker</a>.</li>
  <li>A <a href="https://www.instamojo.com">Partner-in-Crime at <strong>Instamojo</strong></a>.</li> 
  <li>I also started an online magazine &mdash; <a href="http://thefriendz.biz">the Friendz</a> during high-school.</li> 
  <li>More about me on my <a href="http://www.kingsidharth.com">personal website</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since my first post from <strong>May, 2010</strong>, this little website has come a long way. It's often been on front page of Hacker News and has been featured in mainstream and alternate media.</p>

<h3>F.A.Q.</h3>
<p><strong>Who the hell are you? Writing this stuff? What have you done in life?</strong><br/>
I've tried answering that before; but if you've reached <em>this</em> tone there is nothing that I can say that will convince you of anything. Think of me as a self proclaimed pompous ass/kid and ignore me. Please, I insist.</p>

<p><strong>Do you speak at events?</strong><br/>
<a href="http://64notes.com/speaking">I love doing that.</a> Let's talk about it: king@kingsidharth.com
</p>
<p>
<strong>I don't agree with what you say.</strong><br/>
Nice to know but that's not a question.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Do you accept design work?</strong><br/>
<strike>Sometimes.</strike> <strong>Not anymore</strong>. But <a href="http://twitter.com/kingsidharth">happy to help</a> if I can.</p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>How much money do you actually make?</strong><br/>
What are you, income tax department?</p>
<p>
<strong>What the heck?</strong><br/>
I have no idea either.</p>
