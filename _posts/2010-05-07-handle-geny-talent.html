The new generation is not loyal to you, don't expect them to be. They are loyal to themselves. They are more enterprising than ever. Trying to contain them will be failure of you and waste of them.

They will never work for your growth, they value their growth more. So how do you handle selfish talent like us?

You can try and make us your company and make us work for you. That might work well for a part, but soon you will be exhausted and dead. We will be free anyways.

<em><strong>Or</strong></em><!--more-->

You can treat us as individual professional and make us part of your success story and be a part of our success story. That will work so well for both of us.

You have the choice, at least for the time being. Till we take over all markets.

You cannot have a graphic designer work for you and give off his best. But you can very well have a graphic designer work with you to shape your brand<strong>. For &amp; With are difference that we were born knowing.</strong>

Google knows that â€“ they can't run a world class, leading edge Company with talent squeezed in. They have to make it flow through. Most of it will be wasted but what they get dominates the world.

<a href="http://www.mindvalley.com/about-us">Vishen Lakhiani</a> knows that. He and he is there with the best workplace ever.

Kids today don't want to be kept. They are keepers of themselves.<em><strong> You have to learn the new ways or die.</strong></em> You will, eventually.
