<p>If you're alive on twitter, probably you noticed a flood of #Dup19 â€” we did have a lot of fun. I've never seen so many designers in one place.</p>

<p>The most significant idea, that stood-out for me, was "consequences" in design. An alternate way to look at it â€” the golden rule for design:</p>

<p><strong>Treat others like you'd like to be treated.</strong></p>

<p>turn it to the Golden Rule in Design:</p>

<p><strong>Consider consequences for others like you'd have them considered for yourself.</strong></p>

<p>The economic advantage of a diverse team becomes evident here, speaking of which â€” at Headout, we've always wondered why we have more men applying for the design team than women.</p>

<p>But looking at the gender diversity at DesignUp was sad, and should be a wake-up call for us as a community. Where are we going wrong as a community & society?</p>

  The second theme was â€” from design, building products to management, and AI â€”
  everything is a messy process. Most of my favourite talks and panellist
  highlighted their struggles, failures, and were able to look at the real
  big picture and impact of their work.

<p>
  <a href="/newsletter/design-twitter-and-process/">In my first newsletter</a>, we spoke about the stagnant Graphic Design pay in
  the industry â€” a discussion that came up when Pablo Stanely released free
  to use illustrations.

<p>
  The 2019 Dribbble report doesn't look too bright; Graphic Designers are
  among the least paid profession in design by a lot.

<p>In a recent discussion with designer friends, a theme emerged â€” "web designers" broke away from that label and specialised in various fields. That hasn't happened for graphic designers for decades; in fact, the opposite may have occurred with the market expecting more multi-talented graphic designers than a specialist.</p>

<p>However, this alone will not solve the entire problem. Animation & Gaming industry as many specialised designers, but in conversations with folks from that background â€” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLAi_cmly6Q">it has problems</a>.</p>

<p>There's much to think about, discuss, and fix. If only we had a problem solving professional with tools that can change behaviours ðŸ¤”</p>

<hr>

<p>Design purely for social good, and companies and designers aligning and making a mark in the world reminded me why I drifted towards design.<p>

<p>Let's not stop dreaming. But let's take time to inform our dreams with constraints and problems of our fellow human beings.</p>

<p>Charity begins at home. How can we more kind to ourselves?</p>
