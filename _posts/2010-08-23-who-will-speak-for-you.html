As a kid, I always thought that I will tell all those people who are wrong – when I grow up / when I have a voice. I will appreciate and award those whom I really love – when I grow-up / when I have a voice.

I am not alone, a lot of us thought that as kids. Surprisingly, most of us are <a title="sill waiting to grow-up" href="http://www.64notes.com/my-mentor-was-a-5-years-old">sill waiting to grow-up</a> and for that voice. Let me tell you what, the voice is not anyone's to give you, the growth is not anyone's to assert on you. You get to choose.<!--more-->

You get to choose when you speak-up, you get to choose when you are heard. You get to choose when you grow-up. You can choose.

Let it be today – when you speak-up. All it takes is a tweet, a blog or just an email.

It's today and now – or never. Speak-up what you believe in because no one else will.
