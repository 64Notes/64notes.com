Often, entrepreneurs delay a decision for long trying to figure out the ‘right’ decision. Guess what? There is none!

You never get it done (your passion – which can be your start-up) and you never get it wrong. And the reason you never get it wrong is because you never get it done – you can always <a href="http://www.64notes.com/small-business-are-better">improve and be better.</a><!--more-->

Non-decisive state waters down the passion and you ask <em>“Dude! I was so passionate about it; but not anymore.”</em> Just make a decision – making one is important than making a right one or best one.

You have the ability to make any decision the right one.
