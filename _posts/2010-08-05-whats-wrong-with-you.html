So much focus on <em>“What’s wrong with you / this / that / everything.”</em> Looks like most people are trying to figure or point out what is wrong.<!--more-->

Bosses are busy telling that to their employees. Critics are busy telling that about products and mentors to entrepreneurs. <strong>Stop for a moment</strong> and turn the other cheek. Look at what all is right, try to expand it. That is where you will find solutions for what is right.
