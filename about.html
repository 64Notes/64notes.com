<p>
<strong>64Notes</strong> began as an experimental online dump for some of my notes about <strong>entrepreneurship, startups, business, and (eventually) design</strong>. Just the act of rewriting the note sometimes lead to notes becoming essays.</p>

<p>Now <strong>64Notes</strong> has become a timeline of my thoughts. Some of the old writings bring smile, laughter and, at times, even clarity. I intend to keep adding new ones once-in-a-while. Also, then there's a list of the <a href="/speaking">talks</a> I've given.</p>

<p>I solve <strike>dragon</strike> design problems at <a href="https://www.instamojo.com?partner=team">Instamojo</a>. I've been working with/at startups since I was 16 something. You can find more about me <a href="http://www.kingsidharth.com">here</a>.</p>

<p>Since my first post in <strong>May, 2010</strong>, this little website has come a long way. It's often been on the front page of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com" target="_blank">Hacker News</a> and has been <a href="http://www.kingsidharth.com/media-mentions/">featured in mainstream &amp; alternate media</a>.</p>
