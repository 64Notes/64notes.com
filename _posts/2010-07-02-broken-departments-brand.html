Recently <a href="http://www.64notes.com/finding-customers">I went to ask about credit cards in </a><em><a href="http://www.64notes.com/finding-customers">ICICI</a></em><em><a href="http://www.64notes.com/finding-customers"> Bank</a></em>, at help desk they pointed me to basement. No one at the desk for next two minutes in the basement. And when they meet me, they send me to top floor again. Finally they say that they don't want me as a customer!

None of them sure about why I am in front of their 'department'. "Oh! That department is over there." They say, why not<!--more--> f*cking take me over there? It's your bank after all and I am your potential customer!

It's so funny to see a bank as broken departments - so dysfunctional. Like your hands refuse to help you balance because it is leg's job.

On a similar note when you call <em>AirTel</em>, they often tell you that you have called a wrong department and they give you another number which will never work. Just f*cking transfer the call? A telecom company can't transfer a call? Wow!

Remember this mr-who-so-ever-it-may-concern, for me you are 'the' company. I don't give a damn what department you belong to, I need my answer… and if you don't have one just say that you will have it and go ask it to whom you know better. Spare me the horror or your brand is useless… run departments instead.

It's your job to make your departments communicate and channel the customer through sale, not my job to act as middle man between you.
