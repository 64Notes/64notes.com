title: My Secret Way to Find Good Names for Projects & Startups
type: post
---
<p>A lot of people struggle to find a good name for their projects and startups. Many people either end up crow-sourcing the name (something that has thin chance of success) or end up taking a bad name. I've done that too - '<em>the FRiEnDz</em>' &amp; '<em>Meditation Rocks!</em>' were one of the worst names I ever chose for my projects.</p>

<h3>The Good Names</h3>
<p>But recently I've been helping a lot of people find good names. It's been working well: <em>64 Notes, Createens, Spojit, Besperk</em> etc were really great names (IMO). I've <a title="discussed here what a good name is" href="http://www.64notes.com/naming-your-brands">discussed here what a good name is</a>, but to brief it up:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Make the name unrelated to the work.</li>
	<li>It will save you from prejudice people have with 'associations'.</li>
	<li>It will give you freedom to take it in any direction you want to.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Classic Web Design Pvt. Ltd.</strong> - <em>a very bad name for a web designer firm / agency.</em></p>

<p><strong>Classic</strong> - <em>better.</em></p>

<p><strong>Clasio</strong> - <em>much better.</em></p>

<p>You get the idea.</p>

<h3>The Secret Doorway to New &amp; Awesome Names</h3>
<p>This process has evolved over time. The idea is simple:</p>

<p>Look for 'verbs' in foreign languages that somewhat relate to what you do (but should not make it obvious).</p>

<p>Example: <em>Besperk</em>, earlier <em>Createens</em>, is derived from misspelling of '<em>te Bespreken</em>" which is loosely "<em>to discuss</em>" in Dutch.</p>

<h4>How I went about the process:</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Decided to look for words "discuss" - that's what <em>Besperk</em> is about. [List 3 words the describe what you do]</li>
	<li>Tried different languages in <a title="Google Translate" href="http://translate.google.com/">Google Translate</a>. [Look for translations in different languages]</li>
	<li>Try different variations: discuss, discussions etc. will give different results (duh!)</li>
	<li>Look for a 'sound' that is easy and catchy.
<ul>
	<li>Don't look for how 'they' say it - look for how you and your target audience will say it. Think cultural context. How you say 'garcon' and how French people say it is different.</li>
	<li>Avoid confusion phonetics.( <em>Matsatura</em> is a bad idea)</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Modify it so it can be spelt easily. Leave out some syllables if necessary. (So <em>Matsautra</em> can become <em>Masasura</em> or <em>Masa</em> or <em>Sura</em>)</li>
	<li>Short list 3-5 such words.</li>
	<li>Look for a .com domain - you will be left with 2 (usually you are lucky enough to get one) to choose from.</li>
</ul>

<p>Swedish, Dutch, Danish and Sanskrit work the best for me.</p>

<p>I hope this one is helpful. It can get a bit tricky but works well.</p>

<p><strong>Bonus Tip: </strong>Using a language that your target segment doesn't come from works the best.</p>

<p><strong>Good Names I found using this method:</strong> Besperk, Ogmerk, Oyake, Verloop</p>

<p><strong>PS:</strong> <em>Matsaura</em> was a Japanese warrior; his name is pronounced as Maa-saa-su-raa.</p>
