<p>While each one of us is born naturally curious, the education system &amp; our mental-models, that our society runs on, train it out of us. Owning and honing this curiosity can change our lives — especially in the age of the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the internet, education yourself and building a career &amp; wealth has become the easiest it has ever been. You can pick-up any soft-skill, learn a language, learn to design, build an app, learn programing, find jobs and freelance gigs across the world, collaborate with folks, or even network and build a brand. &nbsp;We can either use the internet to stalk our crushes and ex-s or use to our advantage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My journey with curiosity &amp; internet led me to try out my hands at the business starting at the age of 12, and then being a part of Indian startup ecosystem with <strong>Instamojo</strong> (2012-2019) and now across the world with <strong>Headout</strong>. Working startups &amp; building industry-changing products is my calling. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Startups create wealth — and wealth is better than selling time to get money. However, wealth &amp; success both are subjective — for some, it can be owning shares, IPs, or degrees, for others, it can be a stable relationship, living a healthy &amp; natural life. So how do you find and define your criteria of success? How do you #findyourpassion? &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The first step</strong> is to expose yourself to various ideas until you start getting interested in something. You can use the internet to do this — Wikipedia &amp; YouTube is your friend here. (both free!) &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The second</strong> step is to try and invest effort into your interest and gain some skill &amp; experience — you can find tutorials &amp; people online to help you with this. &nbsp;Once we start putting effort and see the results — that's when half the "interest" drop from viable options. Some that stick will turn into a passion as you continue to invest focus &amp; time in it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In the world where most mundane jobs will be taken over by AI, just a college degree won't be enough. More and more startups &amp; jobs will revolve around multi-disciplinary people. Don't wait for a sign form the universe — skills &amp; learnings compound over time — startup today. &nbsp;</p>
