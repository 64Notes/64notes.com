  "It takes too long for the money to reach my account."
</blockquote>

<p>
  Businesses use Instamojo to receive a payment. It takes up to 3 working days
  for the money to hit their bank account (payout). Settlement cycles are an
  industry standard
  (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/what-do-t1-t2-and-t3-mean/"
    target="_blank">T+3 settlement cycle</a>).
</p>
<p>
  This delay is not a problem for a business with sound financial management
  and a steady cash flow, for a small business, cash can dry up fast. The
  problem hits hard when:
</p>
<li>The business requires cash to buy inventory</li>
<li>When the salaries and payables come due</li>
<li>When digital payments is the only sales channel (most digital payment instrument follow the T+3 cycle)
Holidays and long weekends</li>

<h2>Surviving the Cash Crunch</h2>
<p>
  Credit lines from banks are inaccessible to small businesses. For a bank it's
  not profitable to focus on small customers. Business owners are also not keen
  on the lengthy paperwork that a bank requires; they'd rather focus on their business.
</p>
<p>
  Instead, small businesses use personal savings to start the business and
  profits to grow it. Family is the only credit line, if they are well-off.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    Our customers were not asking for faster payouts, they were asking us for a
    short term credit line to fund their business.
  </strong>
</p>

<h2>Solving the puzzle</h2>
<h3>Why can't the money come faster?</h3>
<p>
  Instamojo gets settled in cycles up to T+3 business days. We couldn't transfer
  the money if it wasn't there. Banking infrastructure and regulations are often
  the bottleneck of innovation in our industry.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/manik-singla-8a9a0332/">Manik Singla</a> came up with — 
  <strong>Next Day & Instant Payouts</strong>. As the name suggests,
  these products allow businesses to get money in their bank accounts next day
  or instantly.
</p>
<p>
  Here's how we solved some key problems:
</p>
<h3>Where will the money come from? </h3>
<p>
  Our partners (banks & gateways) take up to T+3 days to settle the money to us
  and sometimes it can take even longer. We cannot send someone the money that doesn't exist!
</p>
<p>
  Credit/loan was the most obvious option. Lending money is the easy part, but
  recollection is hard. Especially when cash flow of the person/business paying
  back is unpredictable. 
</p>
<h3>How much should we lend? </h3>
<p>
  These products were targeted towards businesses with cash-flow problems. The
  cash-flow problems make them a good customer for a credit-line but also deters
  their ability to pay. 
</p>
<p>
  Our customers had the answer - <em>"Just give me the money you owe me in advance."</em>
</p> 
<p>
  They needed the money when an order came in. The credit limit was the payments they received.
</p>
<h3>When and how will the the repayment happen?</h3>
<p>
  The loan is considered repaid when the T+3 cycle is completed. Instamojo
  receives the money from the upstream partners and settles it to the lender.
</p>
<h3>How much will it cost? </h3>
<p>
  When we spoke to our customers they were clear -the <strong>price should be predictable</strong>.
  It makes the decision making easier.
</p>
<p>
  For <strong>Instant Payouts</strong> it is 1% of the payout amount. However, for low-margin
  businesses the price was a deal breaker. 
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Next Day Payouts</strong> comes to the rescue - <strong>get the money in
  your bank tomorrow for just 0.25%</strong>.
  Now businesses can solve most of their cash flow problems with a little planning.

<h3>How will we send the money on bank holidays?</h3> 
<p>The standard way to send money to banks is NEFT/RTGS. NEFT doesn't work on holidays 🤷‍♂️😭. 
<p>We considered IMPS which works 24x7. Every payment could be instantly sent to
  the bank account. That could work if you're receiving 10 payments <em>a day</em>. It'd be a
  lot to deal with if you get 10 payments <em>a minute</em>.
</p>
<p>
  So bundle them up? Sure but the transaction limit on IMPS is ₹2,00,000. So even
  more transactions?
</p>
<p><strong>We turned this design challenge into user delight.</strong></p>

<h2>Money at the click of a button</h2>
<p>
  We explored the idea of scheduled payouts. Eg: payout all the payments 6 times a day.
</p>
<p>
  But could we do better? It still may not solve the ₹2,00,000 limit problem.
  Another concern was the 1% charge. Businesses might not want to put that on auto-pilot.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>We decided to make it a voluntary experience</strong>:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select the transactions you want a payout for</li>
  <li>Check charges & fee</li>
  <li>Click a button…</li>
</ol>
<p>
  <strong>
    …and the money hits your bank account!
    Nothing is more delightful than money coming in.
  </strong>
</p>

  </div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<p>This approach has three advantages:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Users get to choose the exact amount they want to payout</li>
  <li>We can limit each payout to Rs. 2,00,000 (solving the IMPS problem!)</li>
  <li>Our risk analysis system gets more time to flag risky transactions</li>
</ol>

<p>That's not all, Instant payout is also a habit building product.</p>
<h2>The Habit Loop</h2>
<p>
  Habit loop is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning">Pavlovian conditioning</a>: A cue that triggers you to take
  an action and the action has a predictable reward. 
</p>
<p>
  Do this several times over and it will become a habit. You can
