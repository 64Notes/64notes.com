People want to protect their ideas - their precious million dollar idea. They look into all options like Copyright, Intellectual Property Rights, Patents and what not. But nothing makes sure that it's safe.

I have a better way. It's not 100% safe for idea but better than present options - keep the idea close to your chest and die with it.

Do that, chances are it will go with you and if it stays - you won't regret it being leaked.

Need the worst option?<!--more-->

Execute it! Yes it makes sure that your idea is exposed; but consider this:
<ol>
	<li>All those who can work on your idea don't have time to steal yours. They are protecting their.</li>
	<li>Ideas die without air and growth.</li>
	<li>It is easy to copy the idea but impossible to copy the tree you grow out it once it is executed.</li>
</ol>
Anyways, ideas are not born in mind - they are born in consciousness. Just like you had it, soon someone else will have it too. Or maybe they are working on it already.

You choose - die or execute. Or that patent officer might steal it - they know how to work around law. <strong>World is not safe for ideas.</strong>
