Customers are easy to get. Give them something they want and get money in return - they are your customers. Every company has customers.

Audience is harder to get, these are the people who listen to you, learn from you and whatever you say means a lot to them.<!--more-->

Fans are rare to get, they love you, talk about you, maybe even worship you.

I am a customer of British Library, but I don't care about what they say or do (not anymore). I am audience of 37 Signals - what they say mean a lot to me. I am a fan of Thesis Theme Framework - I love it.
