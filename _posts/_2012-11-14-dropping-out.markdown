> "Don't be too artistic!"

These words were spoken by one of my professors at arts college, where I **was** pursuing my graduation. 

Irony! But not their fault. They were right - first years students are not expected to perform arts too much. So if you're artist - slow it down. Dumb it down. Go at the pace of others.

Sit down 5 days a week, 9-5 studying things that might not interest you - that even the teacher isn't happy teaching. Why? No one spoke against it for generations, why should you? Just give them 4 years of your life, get a degree and get out.

Colleges, in my not so humble opinion, run on mom logic - Why? Because I said so! Cute when it's mom but irrational when it's life.

Pardon my Sanskrit, but fuck that shit!

I love college. It has taught me a lot. Oh not the profs or classes - but people & friends. If it weren't for my adorable friends in college, I wouldn't be who I am today. My seniors taught me more art in 1 hour than all the proffesors put together in 1 year. Rest is useless.

**College is fun. But I need to focus on my career and education - so dropping out.** I will let experinces and travel be my education and seeking joy & satisfaction be my career.

The decision is not bold or scary or corageous. Courage is needed when you're stepping in the dark, not when you're already in the dark seeking the light. To me the decision is the most natural thing.

Spending 4 years of my life in a place that can't even rationalize it's own existance and practices and doing things that never make sense - well very very unatural. 

Here is an open letter to all elders, whom I respect immensly:

> Dear Elders,

> I've seen what you done so far. Looks nice! But I know your secret - you just pretend to have answers most of the times. So I've learned not to take your word for it. 

> I will ask you a simple question - "Why?". If you don't have an answer, please admit it.

> I will respect you nonetheless.

> Sneeringly,
> Your Future

For now I need to pratice exactly that. I am elder to many now, especially those whom I address and interact with. Need to start practising to be honest with them when I don't have an answer.
