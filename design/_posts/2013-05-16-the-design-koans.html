title: The Design Koans 
type: post
category: design

<p>I wrote them for <a href="http://www.64notes.com/end-of-web-mutiny">Web Mutiny</a> and refined them with help of <a href="https://twitter.com/thecalmsun" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Roma</a>. They aim at expressing simple things about my design philosophy that I believe people tend to miss out. They are more on lines of poetry than koans, but hey.</p>

<h2>The Real Design</h2>
<p>Design that just looks beautiful is mediocre<br/>
Real science solves problems<br/>
Simply, thus beautifully<br/>
That is real design</p>

<h2>What Design Can Do</h2>
Designers engineer experiences<br/>
to deliver results that matter<br/>
Better engagement, better conversion, better metrics<br/>
That is what design can do</p>

<h2>On UX &amp; Revolution</h2>
<p>Stylists create looks<br/>
Technicians create technology<br/>
Designers create experiences<br/>
Revolution, in an industry<br/>
Is a byproduct of experiences</p>

<h2>Good Designer vs. Great Designers</h2>
<p>Design is like food<br/>
A good chef makes it smell, taste and look great<br/>
But a great chef makes it healthy too</p>

<h2>Startups &amp; Design</h2>
<p>Startups change the world<br/>
There is one in every corner<br/>
Like a million stars in the Milky Way<br/>
Let design help you shine</p>
