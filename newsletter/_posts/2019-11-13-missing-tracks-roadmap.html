<p>Every company, with or without planning, runs two tracks with design, product, & engineering:</p>

<div class="img img--100cent">
  <p class="text-center">
    <img src="{{ image_path }}new-stuff.png" alt="We keep adding new stuff">
  </p>
</div>

<p>We often talk about "bias to ship"; but if you ship too much on the New Track; debt will increase exponentially.</p>

<div class="img img--100cent">
  <p class="text-center">
    <img src="{{ image_path }}new-stuff-causes-debt.png" alt="New Stuff Creates debt which requires more free stuff to solve">
  </p>
</div>

<p>If you solely focus on the debt track, it will add to the new track once we've found a reliable solution.</p>

<p>Things get worse when you sit down to define — What is new vs fixes? What's critical? — these definitions are blurred.</p>

<p>New creates debt which requires new-new stuff, and the cycle repeats.</p>

<p>We have no formalised process to break this spell. But our friends at agile are, as usual, onto something. I love stealing ideas, and this time I want to borrow — "Sprint Retrospective".</p>

<p>Where the teams gather to see what went well, what went wrong, what needs to change.</p>

<p>What if we extend this idea to full organisation, and officially add it to our roadmaps:</p>
<div class="img img--100cent">
  <p class="text-center">
    <img src="{{ image_path }}retrospective-and-remove-track.png" alt="All stuff must go through restrospective after going through Debt or New Stuff tracks">
  </p>
</div>

<p>Every single time a user story/feature/request makes it through either new or debt track; we must run it through retrospective with all teams involved.</p>

<p>During this phase, we talk about things like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Track & document failures and lessons</li>
  <li>Success, the real reason why it worked</li>
  <li>Remove things that didn't work; document what didn't work and what (as a result) should change about company, idea, process</li>
</ul>
<p>This can help us get rid of <a href="https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/resources/mini-encyclopedia-of-be/sunk-cost-fallacy/">sunk-cost bias</a>, which gets magnified with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">confirmation bias</a> in a group. If we kept asking why, how many of our features & products will survive?</p>
