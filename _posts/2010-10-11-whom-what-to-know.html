There is always too much to know and you cannot know it all. And if that was not enough, you have friends who will tell you, "What?! You don't know about that? Looser!"

Nice friends, you have!<!--more-->

There is hell lot of difference between what &amp; who you should know and what &amp; who should know you! You don't need to know about your industry leaders, latest technology or who did what. All you need to know is - What is that you want to do / be / have and what do you need, whom do you contact, what do you do to fulfill that?

Know what you want and how you want it and why you want it. Move in that direction. Rest everything is not good enough for you to know.

So whom or what should you know to be the next version of you?
