Businesses are killing their brand in search of one. They are trying to be something they are not and need not be.

Fancy logos, big bill-boards, fancy websites and all that stuff is not your brand; it's a way of marketing your brand. Your brand is the promise of experience. And <em>nothing</em> beats word-of-mouth as marketing.<!--more-->
<h3>Don't be KFC!</h3>
Last week I went to Rewalsar (Tso-Pema) for a brief holiday. I ate at this restaurant called '<em>Topchen</em>' - just a small balcony above the road, awesome food and amazing service.

Would a website, fancy windows and a proper logo have helped it? No. They had what a brand is - experience. Everything else is complimentary.

You know what made them so special that they are getting mentioned here? They do it in their own way. They don't try to be someone they are not. They are not KFC and don't have fancy advertisements and menus like them.
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
Don't try to be someone you are not. Be yourself - <a href="http://www.64notes.com/usp">that's your USP</a>. It's not about embracing industry standards and molding your brand; it's about making new standards that fit your brand.

Be yourself, your brand will live.
