title: A Career of Money & A Career of Wealth
type: post

While interacting at with students at [NIC 1.0]() I had a chance to meet this bright photographer and a student. He was confused about two paths in his life, as he put it:

1. Engineering - sure shot one. Sallary, job, stability etc. But he wasn't really passionate about it.
2. Photography or other some other passion. Not even sure what that is, not even sure if he can make money.

I like to view it differently:

1. Engineering: No passion thus no contentment. A life full of self doubt, regrets and compromises forever more.
2. A life full of curiosity, adventure, true passion thus real contentment. Usually if you love what you do, money becomes a byproduct.

Somehow the choice is clear for me. [On first path you make money; on second you make wealth.](presentaiton/pg's essay)
