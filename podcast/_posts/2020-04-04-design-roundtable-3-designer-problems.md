## Transcript

**Sidharth:** Okay.
Question time again. When was the last time?
Technical debt impacted, you
know,our ability to deliver [good] design.
yes.
Yeah, yeah.
Give us, give us more, give us more, give
us more example.
So maybe
let's start with that.
Huh?
Let's start with that.

**Arjun:** So, uh, yeah, I mean, it's
something you have to empathize with nowadays.

Like, I don't know if you were like super arrogant about like technical feasiblity.
When people talk about feasible or the
ability to build and then there's time
also.

So right now we are in a phase where we
have everything because we are like
basically trying to save business.
And a lot of the ways that I've been to do
that now suddenly we have to be super
empathetic to everything..
every single team that's in the play,
right?

And technical debt is going to keep, it's
going to keep rising like we have to
accommodate.
But then the problem is it works both ways. Right?

And one thing we don't, we don't realize
is that can create design debt like that, right?

Because we have, we are doing the
visioning process in business process.

You can create design debt.

You can basically chart out a roadmap for
your company in the next few years and
keep it in such way that engineers will
engineering.

We'll just keep chasing that for like two
years.

But that's not how it works, right?
Like in [the] real world.
Markets don't function like that.
People don't functional like that.
You, yourself, cannot predict.

So technical debit is something which you
should be aligned on in terms of like
everyone should know [what] our technical,
capacity is.

It's like in terms of like what is the
capability and the strength of the
organization to execute something, but
beyond that, like it should not be
dictating how you work.

It's like . I don't, I don't put a lid on.

It was all about like making the best use
of what we have in hand. Right? And fabulous.
and it just pissed me off.

So, but then, now I know, I understand all
that.

Yet being involved in the whole process
product manager coming to you and tell you
that, Oh yeah, I spoke to these guys.

Uh, it can be done.

So you've spent a week on LinkedIn what
our time frame movement. Right?

Visioning something we don't want, even
knowing whether it's going to be.

So now that's changed now companies
involve everyone in like grassroots,
basically speaking, all the builders are
in the same room, right?

So now at least that alignment is that
before you even know why, like before you
start running and sprinting, you basically
know that this is the, this is the path.

I didn't, honestly, it's a long way to go.
No designer can ever be happy and in terms
of ability to like, we want everybody to
believe that those are what we want to do.

What do you guys think?

**Hardik:**: Yeah.
I think, uh, it's definitely not a bug.
It's a feature I think is basically like,
like you, you know, how you start thinking
about what is an exception and what's a
norm, right?

The sooner you realize what actually isn't
a norm, the more comfortable you actually
grow to become with it.
Right?

So technical debt, like for somebody who's
starting out in an industry may feel like
it's just.

You are a company that is, uh, you know,
accruing all this debt and that will be
able to pay it.

Then you go on to work at different
companies, and even some large ones, you
realize that it's everywhere.

It's everywhere in various capacities.

Some people manage it well, so people
completely, they can audit and let it
accrue.

Uh, undocumented.

Some teams keep documenting it and paying
your time, sometimes a day just to keep
it.

So I don't think like letting it accrue a
bad area.

As long as you maintain what is acceptable
to you.

Um, as a team, but I like how much offer
does acceptable to you beyond what you
start having to it, uh, in order to bring
it back to the manageable level so things
aren't documented well, manage it really
well.

Um, they documented, basically, I've been
at companies and engineers and meaner
companies, those companies, everybody
knows where we just don't document.
Right.

And then that case, it becomes a very
challenging to even know what we are
dealing against and what you're dealing
with.
Right.

So that's, that's like the company part of
that.

That's, that's the perspective I have.

And the other one is about design.
Um, I think you have to make peace with..
This whole debt thing.

We used to say that there is like a,
there's a design, you could create for an
immediate execution that'd be engineers
can pick up today, and then there are
designs that you create as a, as a vision,
uh, of, of the place where you actually
want to end up in, let's say X amount of
times later.

What ends up happening is that vision part
we spend a lot of time on because that's
like.

I mean, we, we, we have that control and
we have that, we have the necessary tools
to actually keeping by provision, which is
why beating it next division where we
should be struggling them get to at some
point.

Not only is that diluted, that is also
misinformed and also fix and go from lots
of assumptions.

Company, we would go on to be that
company.

The company or the product would go on to
be that product.

So we invest a lot in this, this vision
that is mostly.

Um, unfounded in dreams and which is why
we always compare what we can ship today
with what we think we should have shipped,
as designers and then Delta.
The larger the Delta is, the more unhappy
we are.

The way I've changed that for myself is
not to ever go into full reflection over
the vision version at all.
Because not only is it a waste of time,
it's also of basis.
You are.
Fidelity energy that you could drive in
today's capacity that you're actually
putting in future's capacity, which is
imaginative.

It's just not materialized yet, which
wasn't even probably, you are not even
guessing accurately how much capable you
are.

Your company and your team will be in
future.

So there's no point in making high
fidelity mocks for how our, it would be,
let's say two years down the line.

You can, you can.

You can do like high level learning, you
can do like high level sort of living out
of things and that's about it.
That's where you leaving.

Like even though even the PRDs from really
smart product design or product managers
is don't talk about product with that
amount of certainty as we do about, uh,
about our designs are way far out in the
go into the future.

So what gives us that liberty of having
that certain number of designs that far
into the future.

Um, kind of managers or even the CEO
doesn't have that clarity.

And the more we do that practice, the
model detaches us from like the reality.
Um, and the more it makes us angry about
the technic, like, like, like
Jada, like, but no, that's probably not
the vision.
Right?

So more it's about more being more of a
realist and doing less of the.
Uh, you know, sky panting.
you start thinking is great.
Blue sky painting probably is a
. Um, it, no, it ends up getting the
right.
Like, you remember, Arkun?

Like we paint all those pictures and three
years down the line you still see the
product and not get to . What are you
gonna leave imagined?

Because probably that was not even the
correct, um, like meetings that, that's
one of the products where it ended up
like,
It probably wasn't.

So, yeah, I think we need, yeah, there's a
mind mindset shift or a little bit of
maturity that comes up with like a ton of
expedience and just, you know, being faced
with the same situation.

Even in the top companies in the industry,
we all just go through the same.

So it's, it's like the more ready you are
to accept that that's not an exception,
but I like that.
That is literally part of the process.
Um.

In, in a, in a venture capitalist and
backed
companies like you have to pay the tax.

Otherwise you have like the best score
possible.

You build the best designs possible.
Even when you, when you're, when you have
your grandkids, nobody wants to start.

So speed speed is basically, uh, the
metric everybody's chasing here and that
is the cost that they have to pay.
You know.

**Sidharth:** Makes a lot of sense.
And uh, you know, especially from the
point of view, uh, it seems like it's a
prominent feature and most companies seem
to be, uh, you know, uh, at least
engineers are realistic about, they are
okay with managing it.

And once it's us, you know, leaning and
building goals and it's level vision.
And I can be relate to that because we
still do that to a great extent.

And, uh, you know, how did this, this
discussion makes me think some of that is
that, uh, like how fruitful that is.
I think I'm going to have the discussion
with my team as well after the special.

Mahudri, what do you have to say about
that?

**Madhuri:** Uh, I had, uh, six years of my
life to think about this because when you
have worked with certain companies, you
know how, uh, how they behave in
performance as how the pointed, right?

In our initial years, we are not very
empathetic to this whole process of value
creation.

But we had like, okay, I started here to
the project, the product, this area with
you, and you'll be like, I am still here.
You know, you, you keep thinking about,

Hey, I talked about this.
I dreamt this.
I did the sentence.

And that product would still be with you
initially left it off.

And sometimes the products that you
designed don't even exist because there
are business priorities that are changed
and all of these things.

Uh, the biggest thing that helped me in
understanding technical debt was
understanding the business model canvas.
When you understand how a business
functions, by putting it in those block of
paper sheet, you will actually understand
where and how.

That company prioritizes certain things.
So if you aren't able to nail your
business by using a business model canvas
as a designer, you can empathize more and
as this is truly, it is a feature and you
have to be okay with that, that consistent
step of putting towards that, you know,

Hey, today we will just ship this one
button.

I know about them is a big thing, but it
ships out and then one be cleared up
membership of home, like that'd be happy
to keep building it and moving forward.

And I'm in a position where the product I
am building right now.

The technical debt is on me because I have
to do the management of how is this whole
thing going to ship out and I have to be
okay with the prioritizing certain items
and understanding that BMC kind of helps
you move in that direction and a little
more easier.
And.

To be honest, I, uh, I feel documentation
is a key for everything because many a
times you, you lose sight because you're
shipping currently or you're moving
forward very quickly.

Contexts keep changing.

You wondering who to talk to, who to
communicate to.
You have to document.
If we do not document, we will not be able
to tell people this is what we talked
about things.

And even if you just have like a
retrospective every week, that itself
leads to a lot of good discussions and
decisions that your product might take in
the future.

And that is something I think
retrospective should be very well planned,
especially technical depth, retrospective.
So let me know that we're not going the
direction that we are internally and we
can push back towards the direction we
need.

Uh, it's a fun process.

It's an emotional process because you are
like
keep pointing fingers.

You do all of that, but end of the day,
the idea needs to be reminded and like,
okay, just come on this path.

I understand this and all that.
Skip this, just come on the path.
That is my understanding of technical
debt.

And as designers, we need to understand
business because end of the day, who are
we serving?

A business that wants to make sure that
the product has, should note, it's a value
creation process.

So we need to ensure that we understand
business processes.

They are willing to learn design like our
business.
Okay.
Wow.

**Arjun:** But, empathy is something that that
was what started the, it started the
understanding, I guess.

Like once you have that sense of business
and empathy, then you start going okay
with a lot of things, which earlier you
would have been so stuck available that
you would have guarded it with your life. Right?

So sensitive self curating, alert you, you
clear about what is important and borders
not even from your own designs, right?
And that maturity comes with like being
spent time in the organization.

So you started reading like people's minds
almost, right?
Like how they react to your work and how,
what kind of feedback you can already
expect.

So you can do your first level of curation
already yourself, right?
Like certain ideas are bad ideas.
Second idea of business problems or
product ideas.

So you just jump in and even show them.

So that's really you learning about the
company in the business more than more
just changing the way you work because,
yeah, I mean that's just a natural
evolution of you in the organization as
you spend more time.

**Madhuri:** Yeah.
And your understanding of customer
segments a little more.
Why are paying whatever they are paying.
Except, of course, we understand the we
representative of our customers, right?

But, you also understand that they're putting
their money on it.

So you kind of understand the depths of
why they're doing.

You might get the, you know, Hey, this
person, there's a market understanding,
there's an emotional understanding,
there's a context understanding, and then
there is, you know, monetary understanding
of the soul.

You kind of see the holistic perspective
and you're like, okay, I am now ready to
approach the design in a much more
informed manner than the speaker design.
And that is something we need to learn and
business basics for designers is that is a
very relevant, it's not for the product
matter.

It's not for a just business.
It's for everybody.
It should not have the, this combination
of these aspects.

**Sidharth:** So I, I remember one of the
examples of what a technical debt looked
like, you know, in real life.

And, um, I remember when I was starting
out as a design, I would look at other
people's apps or the people's website and
see a final corner where the design was
not perfect.

Oh, really outdated from the last style.
And I was like, ah, like, you know, they
don't have the eye for perfection.

They have missed out one corner on their
app, which was not polished.
And after being behind building several of
these products, you realize them like, you
know, you realize it's not that easy as
this updating that screen, because maybe
this doesn't make enough money.

Maybe not, not, not enough people use it.
Maybe it's on the record business.
No one understands anymore.
Maybe it's a code base that will have to,
you cannot talk to it because a lot will
come crashing down.

Uh, so you start to realize that.
Uh, you know, a lot of realities exist
from technical point of view and technical
plus business point of view.

Both, you know, because it's, it's, uh,
building systems and there is no perfect
system, right?
All systems are leaky.
So all we can do is manage that leakiness
and keep it in the known zone.
So a black Swan from technical that
reduces, as long as technical lead is not
producing a lot of black swans, it's very
unlikely business will prioritize that.

So there always will be.
Like if you, you know, it was funny, like

Airbnb exists to like enjoy the design
things they do.
I see a bunch of calendars, then, you
know, in that app, et cetera, which are
like.

Really, you know, all all designers, they
haven't touched in years.
I knew like the 200 designers and tons of
engineering, what are they doing?
because it's not that simple.

There are more pressing things.

Then maybe the calendar codebase for this
app is really outdated and no one has got
time to sit down on the related.
So those are the realities start to come
into the picture and you become a more
forgiving of yourself and other people as
well.

And I think part of the reason people feel
designers take that personally as well
because, uh, an outdated product or a
misfunctioning product reflects on you.

We spoke to this last, uh, a little in the
last long table as well.
I like the way it reflects on designers.
So we take it personally a lot more
personally, but this is the dining looking
perfect, or it's not up to the Mark.
This one part that's not my style guide or
a system.

So we take it way more personaly, but
yeah, that's maybe not practical approach.
**Hardik:**: I mean as, as long as like one
thing a really good friend that I worked
with told me was, um, if you want to go
design working with a team of, with, of
course we will be, you have to set up your
own calibration checklist, basically,
right?

Like not everything there.
Do you.
Consider important or mission critical?

Uh, probably is mission critical and
important design.

Like if, if there are 10 things you are,
you are basically discussing with your
engineers or are the seven things that you
are really intending to push on and what
are the three things that you can let go
of and look at live without?
Like if all of those are your P zeros and
the things that you want fixed, it's not
going to happen.

So you have to come you can't, you have to
have that first level of prioritization,
that non voting right.
Um, nobody doing, anyone wants to check
your time and it to them and be asked to
go fix it.

So they, they basically are pressed
against time in the given time.
What, what is a possible version?
Like probably many of the times like get
just get enough Intel cause they will do
this for them.

Having the feature.

Like fully furnished and like perfect down
to the last or like nobody, uh, not a
reasonable amount of people get, um, that
to justify the edge costs it would incur
for all the other users.
it's like for the three users, we would
probably care, you would deprive 3000
users to not have that feature would
already start using it tomorrow.
Right?

So that's the, you have that understanding
of basically what is that number of a life
for your product, right?

If 50,000 people are going to get pushed
for it, right?

So those are the seven things that you
would push for when the three things that
only three people would get out of the
user base.

It's definitely not what they're not even
probably.

So, yeah, that's that.

That's the understanding of the market,
that
if you know your users.

For example, people who want to order food
where people want to order the cab.

Getting a cab is way more important than
what the button looks like, right?

Like so how, what, what end of the
consumption are you on?

Are you in the under luxury?
Are you at the end of your delivery?
If you are a utility app, like you have to
have a different designer mindset about
technical debt.

Like, um, uh, you know, go to market about
features, what secure on the luxury end.
Like your app has seen a very different
context.

So like you probably of optimizing for
many very different things.
Was it like a utility app?

So that's, that's why I like this.
If somebody doesn't have this
understanding, it becomes very challenging
for that kind of a designer to succeed in
like a, like a, a variety of backgrounds,
right?

Like if they go from one company to the
other, they can't.

Did the same mentality, then they can't
adapt to what the needs of the business.
You know?

**Sidharth:** That brings us to a very
interesting and related next topic, which
interesting and related next topic, which
is designers don't get to make the final
call on, you know, a lot of things and
most of the time, in fact, on what gets
shipped out, what version gets picked up,
what features, how features get fed.

And just to speak a little to the reality
of that as to why that is.
Is that a good idea?
When should blindness?
We don't, we're not how we do.
Just to know your thoughts on the topic of
like when designers are not the final
decision maker.

**Arjun:** If
you add to what **Hardik:** just said, right?
this is true.
Even when you're like, it's not like.
Yeah.

It's not a contest, right?
Like that design should have the financing
and this product would have the financing
of this.
It's not late.

Basically you tasting what are your
company's goal is like
you know?
so I in every, in every level, design is
giving us a sign off basis what that goal
is.
Right.

And that goal is something that is a
common goal.

It's a, it's an engineering goal.
It's a particle.
It's a business goal.
It's a, basically a goal with everyone
wants together.

Like, but yeah, having said that, like we
are super picky like when we do pixel
perfection, it's like, know I myself, I've
delayed giving a sign-off on pixel
perfection.

By like a week because I was just not
happy with what I know.
I know that my engineers hated me for
that, but these are some things.
It's like there are some things that
designers would draw lines in.

This is something I will not let you some
things is, I think it's still valid for us
designers to be very attached with that
finesse because some things we know that,
you know, I use those
Right.

Are some, we know that it's very important
for us.

I think some products are for success and
like this empathy is something I'm glad
you the, uh, designers can bring to the
table, because I have noticed that when
you're sitting in the process of shipping,
we get caught in the whole mindset of
chasing the deadline.

The date is everything.

When you're, when you're in like, uh,
regarding like, let's say product company,
but every month we have to meet that date.
Of an app release, right?
You tend to lose out on these things very
often.

So this is something which was very
important to me, that like designers, all
some metrics, like in terms of, I wouldn't
say metrics, but some principles.
In other words, you put the light on and
what you will be okay with it.
Great.

So that's something that's late, but then
like we don't own, we don't own like the
product we should, we need to look at all

**Sidharth:** Interesting perspective.
What do you say to that, **Hardik:**?

**Hardik:**: What Arjun said makes a lot of sense.
Um, one thing I would say is that no
matter how much, how much we normalize
having technical , there is also like, um,
clear case of companies that are just
married, right?

They're not just not like, like you just
can't have a positive mindset dead because
it just is set up for.
For the shipping mechanics and I can, I
don't want him to, like, I don't want us
to not acknowledge bag as well, like that
end of the spectrum that there are some
companies who just consistently put out

Mac practices and bread products and it
goes, just consider the other end of
having a, having picnic and like, Oh, just
keep lowering the bar.
And at some point that there is no bar,
there is no shared understanding of what
quality means for the company at that
point.

Everybody just gives up and then it's
vitals going.
It's, it's the snowballing effect that
just keeps getting worse and worse because
every next 0.7 years,
let's get in love.

To whatever the previous person did,
because that's just, yeah, the culture and
then like, there's no saving from that.
Like you just have to everything in the
garbage bin and just start fresh, which
never happens.
.
There was a great article on like, there
are no never any coordinates, and I work
in a big company.
Now what happens?

It's just not possible.
Otherwise you can pause the company for
like six months and save yet rebuilding
the entire app.

We are fine with it.
cash cashflow for the six months it's
United, which would never happen.
So basically that's done for that product.
So I just wanted to say it like we do it
knowledge there.
Those companies exist and OD on the wrong
end of the spectrum.

But yeah, most companies, right?
Like most companies are very product,
really.

Well, Swiggy, for example, right?
Like consistently, I still remember 2016,
2015 when we were in Instamojo.
I have been a customer ever since then.
And uh, I remember you will be up, would
be on these like.

Hmm.
Like insanely, you're getting calls about
like giving them directions to how to find
the office.

So I didn't start it off.
It's wasn't so hard, but I like the had
like 50 landmarks nearby and then like a
year later we just stopped calling because
they figuring everything out.
Right.

Like it just, we've just progressively,
the ops software, the operations, the
location was handled.

Pick all the garden meaningfully back up.
So I, I clearly saw like the progression
or even before their design got better.
It didn't really matter to me because it
was functioning.
I could order food.
That's all I needed.
I eat.

Everything I listened to was the final 20%
which I could have lived without.
If it meant that I had to not call the
person, which they fixed first grade.
So yeah, like the companies knowing what
to fix first in order to keep the
customers like pick ups for six or
delivery process for just like Amazon,
right?

Like probably not the most beautiful that
even.

For being the most beautiful checkout
websites in the world doesn't match the
delivery.
Always, always, always fall back to them
because I just trust them.

I like, I know I can pick up on line JAG,
like have, might be fun anytime I want,
even if I'm in the wrong.
So that's like focused on the right
things.

And if the company has those starters,
then you would exactly know what the,
where the company, which money the company
puts their priorities.

Some companies just go on and get above
that and there is no amount of thinking
can save you, um, if you're already in a,
in that downward spiral.
Right.

So, um, and yeah, I, I see designers stuck
in those companies asking for help and I
just don't have anything to tell them.
I mean, like, it's just, just go find
somewhere better to work at.

It's not your problem.
It stops becoming your problem beyond a
certain point. Right?

Like, if you want to get a second level.
It's out of your, it's, it's beyond your
paycheck — companies' problems.
So at that time, you just have to show
yourself out.

I like find something better to do with
your time, right?

So that's my other way that it's like
there is no, nothing bothered about what
you are going through.

I think you need to make meaningful steps.
If you are, if your situation leave the
company and something better.
But yeah, I mean, if you end up with a
certain, like now, no, we are all our
extended is whatever.

We can meaningfully impact the way the
company looks at things and like approach
to certain problems.
I think then like leaving about making an
effort is no longer an option for us.

So if there is like a suboptimal practices
in the company, we all, I'm partly
accountable, partly responsible also,
right?

Like now because they're all like
positions where we can.
Make good things happen just as much as we
can make bad things happen if we don't pay
attention.

So like the approach changes based on what
point you're at.

At the same time, anytime time, you have
to be mindful of like, just generally
plain bad companies.

Just leave them venue when you can.
And I mean, acknowledge when you see one
and then leave.
Yeah.

**Sidharth:** Yeah.
That that's, that's very important
balancing perspective.
Mahduri, what can you add to that?

**Madhuri:** Yeah.
It would have been made, including design
doesn't have say, I would say even
sometimes, um, marketing also doesn't have
a seat. Right?

The maturity of the company really
defined.

Then, uh, and what priorities are that
like not, I'm not talking about the design
maturity level one, level two.

I'm not talking about those things.
Also because big companies, I don't think
we feed the people in the companies also
need to have that maturity to drive and
make decisions.

The say, for example, in a company like
Phillips, and I don't want to use this
words, but uh, they have bigger teams,
right?

The big design team reports to a, say, a
healthcare division, ECG division.

A lot of these districts, they have to
prioritize what makes sense to them.

If they want design as a priority, then
they will choose designers.
If they want marketing as a priority, it
drives that.

So you cannot say that design has the only
say . But even then as a designer, you
have the responsibility to push your
limits.

You can show how to optimize design.
The better way you can show how to work
with existing assets in a much better way.
There a lot of design systems out there
right.

But you know for a fact that you don't use
them raw just like that.
You're going to take them, you're going to
modify it, and you're going to use them.

And if you are in a company that is not
having systems in place, can you send that
within your power?

How much can you extend?
But beyond the point, you cannot because a
lot of cultural systems at play, which
will kind of, you know, come into place
if, for example, a simple thing like, Hey,
uh, you know, if, um,
If this in wants to open up a second
marketing material.
Right?

This is going out in certain X way.
Can you to design it, improve that and
prove that you, uh, the design is a very
critical asset and it is responding
better.

We have metrics to show that probably this
has Y likes and the previous one has X
likes.

It's simply be distinct.
Can we enable design in a better way?

So that is one other side is our
responsibility to max limit.
The other side is accepting the fact that
this exists and I have to make use of
this.

It has to run both ways.
It's a two way street.
It cannot be like I as a designer will
have fun and say, you figured out about
everything that never works.
You have enabled both sites.
And to be honest, in all the aspects that
I have worked with, we are a part of the
team.

It's never you vs.
me.
It's all we.

So this, you know, how are we getting the
work done?

That is how it is.

And this you vs.
me has to stop somewhere.

I understand it's human to be you versus
me, but somewhere we need to get in saying
that we are all in the same board.

It's not a work.

You know, product was, this designed
design was smarketing.
Discussions don't make sense.
That's where the maturity comes in.

**Sidharth:** Makes a lot of sense.

And, uh, you know, just to, uh,
consolidate what we, you know, spoke about
and I don't have much to after that, they,
they can, uh, you know, there is, uh, we
are on the same table.

We are on the same page, I believe, the
same product and understanding the reality
of business, understanding the reality of
decision making.

And there's miss can help a lot and but
there are certain companies which just can
use bad quality products.
Um, but as people who are now have seat at
the table, we should attempt to push for
that sort of change and accountability.

But if we are not able to, then it makes
complete sense to move on and find a
better place to work.
Um, and, uh, you know, which brings me to
an interesting sub question, very related
to that.

And designers, we are often prioritizing,
you know, a balance of form and function
very often.

Talk about like, you know, the function is
the form.

But at times within business, the form
starts getting priority or aesthetic start
getting priority,
uh, even though it's not a priority to
you, or the for design for the user, but
business or marketing or somebody in the
business wants to push for like, Hey, this
does not look sexy, or does it look great?
This does not look as as amazing as it
could.

Uh, does that happen?

And what do you do in those scenario?
Why did that happen when business
prioritizes form over function.
**Arjun:** But that's a sad.
**Hardik:**: Never happens to
me

**Arjun:** Like it's happened a lot of, I know
that it has an occupational hazard.
I've come to terms with the fact that
everyone will have it.

Um, but as it happens in a way where, you
know, yeah, like like, just give us
something punchline and you quickly like
go and design something class and they
like
nice.

I'm like, what happened?

And that sounds like you were dying one.
It was
ask you what's missing.

**Sidharth:** And this
is the best, I'm sure.
What is it missing?, yeah.

**Hardik:**: Oh my God, this is the best we can
do is the worst questions.
Yeah.
Good.

I've heard things like, um, this doesn't
have "Umph".
This doesn't have the x factor.

**Arjun:** Yeah, that Umph word is MBA, don't
you guys?

Can we like bucket these people?
Right?

**Hardik:**: What is that is Milan and
Barcelona fashion shows up for those are
for the old people.

Who actually want the hello on some pomp
and sparkle can spark that.

Like a imagine a mobile phone on a ramp
showing your app on the screen, right?

Like that's basically why.
See your dad is like, can I show this to
him?

Like a flashy board meeting.\* rants\*. The best thing is like, I know, I know
we are planning to do a separate episode
on this.

Well, I just wanted to like, and that is
called spoiling back a little bit.
You have that UX designer, then your team
now or her come up with some, um, uh,
really good marks and then you add some,
your, some of your like final UX, sorry,
final visual spark on it.

Now you just do the some leg viscerally on
it now.

So that to me is equally that
understanding of how we actually work in
our, in our, wizard caves.

And I ate like basically. \* rants \* and then there are some designers with
some glitter
I'll be . Oh, don't do that.
Yeah.

**Arjun:** It's so
you can actually learn to laugh about it.
At one point of fame, this was to be like,
like this used to like put, does offer
days, you know, like they used to bog us
down for month because are they going to
have been part of these processes that was
so big at the time and in very, very tight
time.

And it just started when the feedback is
you only get you these words, like friend,
like Java and all this crap is
just like, you only start getting two
because they're so weak.

You give me something pointed, pointed
feedback.

**Hardik:**: It's also extremely subjective.
Might just be a terrible idea or breaking
all accessibility laws that says why we
see products like the most famous credit
card payment app in the market.

I'm like, that's just breaking
accessibility rules on every single
screen, right?

Why should buttons look like buttons?
Why should icons look like icons?
Why should anything..
The copy look readable?
Who reads product copy.
Right?

Like it's, it's, it's hurting be a stick.
It's of the screen.

Could we put so much text?
So like when, when own started driving or,
um, you are physicians,
you end up with something like that,
right?

Like you end up with something that's
barely functional.
Okay.

That is no surprise that people are
annoyed with her consistently bring that
up in the community.
Right.

Because it's that you're private about the
wrong things.

Like it's, I think it's completely
understandable that you want to make it.

Like really attractive and that is
something that you spend as our Dean, the
last 5% 4% effort on once everything and
says, this is problems.

Find T I completely get the need for like
shiny fine.
That's fair.
Right?

And there are, there are leavers you can
tweak in your UI arsenal to make that
happen.

All right, cool.
Meeting them.

Something looks like sort of inviting.
. It's not the starting point, it's it.
You can never be the starting point.
Like that can never just be the goal of
making something really attractive and
like it's a moving target first of all, in
the beginning, because nobody knows what
well, the frame, the frame of that thing
is.

I love the shape of that.
The shape isn't clear.
You can't paint it with the right color.
Right.

So if you have to get that first 95% of
getting,
then can you do a final
yeah, yeah.
is a masania.

That's another one.
Like it's not dead.
It's not bad.
Yeah.

It's truly to
Have you done this?

Like if somebody gives you feedback that
this is not fun.

I literally gave the same screenshot
again.

Oh yeah, man looks so much better, and I'm
like, I didn't change anything.

**Sidharth:** I think I'm going to try that.

**Hardik:**: You wouldn be surprised.
Keep eight out of ten times.
You'd actually just the passes tohrough.

People just assume that you've been there,
done that
by glitter addition.

So I think it's, it's very, it's, it's a,
it's like all logical, right?
Like this clearly tells that it's
psychological.

They just want, we'll make sure that you
have given but then you have actually, or
not, doesn't matter.

It's irrelevant.

I just want to make sure, like the ice man
negative.

Sometimes they just need that assurance.
They don't want to read the final outcome.
They just need assurance that you did
something in their words.

**Sidharth:** They want to make sure that you
give your best.

**Madhuri:** Yes.
No.

You gave you a magic Maggie masala.
You added, you make it my masala.
That's what it is.

**Arjun:** We
sound like a
support
group
now.
**Hardik:**: We already established in the
we can go on forever on this.

**Sidharth:** That is so true.
Locked up.
Right.

**Hardik:**: The little bit of positive in
this, I just, I just don't.
Like get flustered by these observations
anymore.

It doesn't, doesn't bother me at all.
you'll be fine with it.
Yeah.

Like it's, I just didn't make an effort to
like appease to those kinds of remarks
anymore and good PMs and good CEOs.

I understand that now.
Like if you're already giving them like
the best possible outcome in a given
context.
but I haven't had good, have had people
shared with me
links from Dribble to
share ideas for the buttons and then they
come out with like . "Why isn't
our button
like this?"

Mean, usually I ask a question you, I tell
you where did you find this?
Can
I download the app?
Oh yes.

I would tell Mac, you guess I like, how do
I like, how do I test it?

How do I make sure I met metal?
I say something like, I want to copy one
button.

Most authenticity can I download the app
where it's used so that I can use it in
exactly.
Copying

It's basically like, and then realise it
can't be
done.
They just stopped giving any more Dribbble
links.

I found it insulting the firs time and I'm
like,

**Madhuri:** I
was remembering this horrible story?
So we were trying to design a brochure for
one of the clients because it was part of
the process of the final deliverable.

She wanted to give a specific color.
She actually showed her bathroom tiles.

**Arjun:** Wow.
That sells.
that is a good sell.

**Madhuri:** She took the laptop to the
bathroom during the call.

**Hardik:**: If this can look good on a
bathroom
tile; why not our app?

Sidharth, you rememebr that meme right?
You and then you and then [missing] the
point.

It's such a timeless meme.
It'd be used more than it is
I really have not seen that.
Dual use it everywhere.
On Slack.
Everywhere.
Yes.
Innocuous mean

Then we can continue our conversation.

**Sidharth:** Folks, thank you so much for
listening in and thank you so much for
watching.

Uh, this was it for this episode.
The next episode we're going to continue
the rest of our rant.
