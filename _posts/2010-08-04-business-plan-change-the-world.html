There is a business plan you make for the world - to make them believe in what you do. I don't know about you, but I never could use those documents for my own good. My vision evolves too fast for business plans.

To remind myself of where I am headed and what my 'plan' is tr -d '\r' <  > __ I answer a simple question:<!--more-->

<strong>What am I going to change in the world?</strong>

Or

<strong>How this would affect the world?</strong>

No it need not change the way we talk - that big a change needs a successful history from you. But even small changes matter.

Try to answer this question personally.
<h4>Here is an example:</h4>
In high school junior year, I had a friend tr -d '\r' <  > __ over passion and ended up nowhere.

In relation to that I answered the question “<em>What am I going to change in the world?”</em> for '<em>the FRiEnDz</em>' : <strong>How is 'the FRiEnDz' going to change the world?</strong>

<em>Rhythm won't have to leave what he loves because everyone else wants him to do something he doesn't love.</em>

That is the direction 'the FRiEnDz' is moving in. You are not inspired by 'motto' or 'mission statement' - it really means nothing to you - they are just plain words. But the life experience that inspires you mean everything to you - make that your emotional furnace to fuel the fire of passion.

This type of business <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">plan</span> vision is every evolving - just like you. Keep checking off the things and keep adding to it as you go along.
