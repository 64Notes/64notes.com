<h2>Why are we rebranding</h2>

<p>
  For the last few weeks, we' been busy rebranding Headout. Why, you ask?
</p>

<p>
  The existing brand, while works well, has several issues:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Too many colours to support edge-cases with no coherent colour system</li>
  <li>The brand message is fragmented, and all communication — from content to illustration end up singing different tunes</li>
  <li>Hard to formulate new ideas or extend this "glued together" system — because it doesn't have any cornerstones or governing principles</li>
</ul>
<p>
  We started by consolidating insights from staff & customers. NPS, surveys, and in-person interviews were a great help here. We kept narrowing-down our definition of what Headout is, what it stands for, who are customers are, what impact do we want to have, etc till answers emerged.
</p>

<p>
  From there on, mood boards have been a great help in expanding-on & exploring ideas. Now with our core story, values, and principles in place — we've been moving fast and documenting every step along the way.
</p>

<p>
  I hope to turn it into a mini-documentary. Would you like to watch it? Or should it be traditional — Introducing the new Headout blog post?
</p>

<p>
  Another critical insight that emerged was "how to converge" in a meeting. Discussions during a brand meeting can take wild-turns; the only way to keep focused and arrive at the answer is to keep asking the right questions.
