You know what, sweetie? The path of life is not know to any. You tend to find lose ends. But life doesn't end there. You can always go back and start again.

**Just like this page - it doesn't exists.** Or something has gone wrong. Don't feel bad. You're pretty. Just chill out and dive in the [archives](/archives). And if this was really important to you - you [send me kisses & tell me what you were looking for](http://twitter.com/kingsidharth). Will try to help ya.

Now that you're here and you're still reading this. I want to share a poem written by Zen master Hoshin just before his death:

**I came from brilliancy.**

**And return to brilliancy.**

**What is this?**
 
This line was one line short of the customary four, so the disciple said: 

**"Master, we are one line short."**

Hoshin, with the roar of a conquering lion, shouted **"Kaa!"** and was gone.

Just saying.
