<p>N.I.C. Fest 1.0 - organized by the brilliant <a href="http://thebrats.in">The Brats</a>.<br/> 
I learned so much from this crowd of young geniuses! The whole idea of education being teaching kids is ridiculous - one must go to school to learn from these brilliant minds.</p>

<p>After talking to most of the youth present there I feel like taking their autograph well in advance, boy they are gonna rock the world.</p>

<p>Special thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/adityanayak">Aditya</a>, Anshuman, Ron & Dhruv - and their parents - their dad is so full of energy and their mom makes the most delicious aalo-ka-parantha ever!</p>
