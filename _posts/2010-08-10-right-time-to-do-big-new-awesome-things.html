  thesis_post_image_alt: Now is the Right Time to do Good Things
---
While expanding my personal notes to these blog posts, I often come across a note which is relatively a new learning. I often catch my self saying, <em>“I can’t write about that. I need to practice it and learn more about it.”</em> Or <em>“It’s a new idea. I should wait.” </em>Or even worse, <em>“It’s such a good idea. I will blog about that later.”</em>

Many of us want to put awesome / new things off for later – for the right time.<!--more-->

<strong>When are you gonna start-up?</strong>

<em>Later, when the time is right.</em>

<strong>When are you starting to blog?</strong>

<em>Not now, it’s going </em><em>to be</em><em> good – I am not feeling like it.</em>

… and on it goes.

It’s fun to challenge that later and do it now! You will be amazed at how good you are. <a title="I believe there is no right or wrong decision; you have the ability to make any decisions the right one." href="http://www.64notes.com/make-right-decision-for-start-up">I believe there is no right or wrong decision; you have the ability to make any decisions the right one.</a>

<strong>Extension</strong><strong>:</strong> There is no right or wrong day for anything; you have the ability to make any day the day. If you think it’s today – you are right. If you think it is tomorrow – you are right.

<strong>Is it today?</strong>
