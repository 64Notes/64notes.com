I recently read Seth Godin's Free Prize Inside. Here are some thoughts from and about the book:
<blockquote>“We don’t insist on the biggest ads or the latest technology. We want cool stuff. Design matters. Style matters. Extras matter. We want the free prize, sometimes more than we want the thing itself.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“A free prize is the essence of a Purple Cow. … It rarely delivers more of what we were buying in the first place. It delivers something extra.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Fix what is broken.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Inflame the Passionate.”</blockquote>
<strong>Fact:</strong> Without Innovation, you shall die.
