It's almost laughable how companies will go mad about price reduction and loose a fight which no one can win.

You cut a dollar, they cut two. Then you cut four and so it goes till there is nothing more to lose. And guess what? Customer hardly cares – ask them how much your stuff costs, they won't know.

There is a limit to how much you can complete on price. Go unlimited - innovate. Innovation is unlimited. Creativity is unlimited. Ways to server your customer is unlimited.<!--more-->

Innovation creates remarkable things and people don't care about their prices. <a title="They just find new ways to love it." href="http://www.64notes.com/turn-customers-into-brand-advocates">They just find new ways to love it.</a>

Soft innovation is the new frontier of war of brands. If you are still busy fighting on prices, you've already lost it.
