Apart from regular shit, there are some interesting things that happen in <a title="my college" href="http://www.64notes.com/to-college-or-not-to-college/">my college</a>. A while ago, we were working on "design" (Design as in design patterns thingy not the logical design).

I did all this by my own hand and a rotring pen, 8x8 inches!<!--more-->

The sheet is called "art card". It's a thick sheet used for printing greetings and such. It has glossy finish, absorbs (rotring) ink quickly and if you make a mistake - you can scratch it a bit and correct it.

But guess what? Our teacher never told us about the scratching bit - about the eraser. Not that we didn't ask; she said, <em>"If you make a mistake, you make a mistake. There is no going back. Start over."</em>

It's a nice thing, we were extra careful while working and more confident after we finished it.

And recently, during drawing class, my teacher (one of my favs) took away my eraser. Good thing. Make mistakes, correct them on the fly and let them be a part of your work.

Entrepreneurs are artists too and making mistakes should be natural. It should be part of the work. No erasers used.

Some of my classmates work very carefully, afraid to make a mistake. They score good but never find out much. While there are those who play a lot and dare to do it wrong. Initially their work is so laughable and eventually they find… themselves.
