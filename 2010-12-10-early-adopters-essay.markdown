It has always been a classic question - If I build something, will people come? Will they honor this new way of doing things? Will they adapt? Will they like this creation of mine?

Almost every new startup / ideas / business / product has this big question - will this work? Well, if you put something out there (especially on the internet) someone will take it, try it and if you are active on social media (let's say you have a following) then the chances of acceptance are greater.

There is this segment of population that loves the smell of "new". _No matter if it's unfinished or buggy - they want their hands in the clay - these are the early adopters._ And they will shape everything around you and perhaps even about you and your creation.

## Traits of Early Adopters:

* They will adopt your technology and give you honest feedback - no they don't mind the bugs and mistakes so _no need to wait till "it's perfect" before you ship - just ship_.
* You really can't declare a USP about your product/service - it's up to your early adopter to acknowledge your USP. And they can find anything to [be a USP](http://www.64notes.com/usp).
* They are very different from your regular users. Users use your stuff. Early adopters shape it with you - they are your co-creators in.
* If you can get a strong tribe of your early adopters going on - they will do be enough marketing for your startup to take off. Many of them will leave eventually - to newer stuff. But they will leave behind a polished shipping and a decent user-base.

**Examples:**
* Facebook was shaped by tech-savy college students (seen The Social Network?).
* No one started buying on Amazon from day one. How could they trust you with their Credit Card?! Well early adopters did.
* Who knew I could write? There were early adopters (readers) of my writing who "saw the thing" in it and encouraged me to do it more.
* Think about it, from "barter system" to "Plasma TV" everyone had early adopters.
* People in _'the Secret Notes'_ mailing list are early adopters of my random ideas.
* Who knew you could walk and end up reading this on internet? Your parents were early adopters :P

Don't get me wrong, there are no people running around with "early adopter" tag on their forehead. It's doesn't work that way. Anyone can be your early adopter - but you need to know the noise from bar-raisers.

> There are people who say speak because they have something to say and then there are those who speak who have to speak something.
This is one of my favourite quotes, it warns you against the noise. You can't "calculate" it; you have to <em>feel</em> the signal from noise. (Reminds me of "choose your ride" scenes from Avatar).

## How to Get Some

Hmm.. So they seem cool people, but where do you get them?

As I said earlier, they can be anywhere so yo better get talking about your ideas and start sharing your thoughts. Speak your mind! Broadcast your-self! (That's what blogging, social media &amp; even [marketing is all about](http://www.64notes.com/the-black-magic-of-marketing")). If "[the dude](http://www.64notes.com/let-them-raise-the-bar)" is passing by - he will notice.

But beware, trying to portraying something you are not won't work. Don't act smart - that's not going to be a meaningful relationship, be who you are because they are going to discover you anyways. Let them see what they want to see - again **don't be afraid to show your mistakes, Ship!**
