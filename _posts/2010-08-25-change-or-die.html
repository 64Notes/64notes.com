Change is the only thing that is not going to change.

Your vision, dreams, path, ideas, work, ways, people, goals, intentions and so on - everything must change. If anyone or any organizations (govt., start-up, company, NGO etc.) refuses to change - they are dead. That's where their downfall beings.

Change is inevitable. It happens even if you try to stop it - but in that case it changes into your death (or death or organization).

Each day everyday, your experiences, questions and problems inspire a change. It's an eternal process.

Change is happening, be part of it or be left out. What change are you a part of, today?
