  “Let’s go with this design; we will instruct [the team] to not write beyond two paragraphs.”
</blockquote>

<p>They didn’t go beyond the two-paragraph limit for a couple of months. Then one day, a new line appeared below the second paragraph one page. It was a new hire who missed this critical bit during the onboarding. Somehow it skipped the manual review. Humans make mistakes.</p>

<p>Now, it’s live. But it isn’t too bad. No one notices it for a while. When it does come to attention, the team creates a bug request to fix it.</p>

<p>The bug fix isn’t House-on-fire-priority, we will fix it next week. The next week comes a couple of months later. By this time, there are a dozen more implementations with more than two paragraphs.</p>

<blockquote>
  “Oh, we assumed it was ok. And we need like two and a half paragraphs.”
</blockquote>

<p>The system breaks further. Two years later, it’s time for a redesign. No one around remembers what was important about the two-paragraph rule; those who are don’t have time to explain what happened. They aren’t even aware this meeting is happening.</p>

<p>They commission a redesign.</p>

<p>It looks fantastic with one paragraph on the dribble shot. But we are not shallow designers; we design it to hold even more sections. Our components work with a vast range of data and use-cases: Design Systems, component library, react-native, and all.</p>

<p>We take pride in it. Two and a half paragraphs? Show 10, write a landing page in there. Modular. Tech Savvy. Sexy.</p>

<p>The customer slowly learns to ignore that component. Eventually, all teams stop celebrating or optimising this star-of-the-show component and design detail. Data doesn’t support it; it’s passe’.</p>

<p>We are redesigning our search now. Data shows that people who search convert better. We researched it for months.</p>

“We wouldn’t recommend breaking this well-researched navigation structure. This is the strict structure we must follow.”

<blockquote>
  “We’ll instruct the team to use this classification.”

<p>Only last week, in the <a href="https://www.64notes.com/2020-industry-trends-tech-design-product/">industry review article</a>, I wrote about how we should see at least twenty more social networks, and more loop & mixed-media content — this week we saw Byte taking over by a storm.</p>
