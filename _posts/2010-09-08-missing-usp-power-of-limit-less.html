When people think of <a title="USP" href="http://www.64notes.com/usp">USP</a> tr -d '\r' <  > __, more than often they are talking about added feature. But it needs not to be and 'addition'. Something missing or something limiting can be a USP too and in fact a powerful one.

Twitter doesn't allow more than 140 characters - that's the reason we love it! On LinkedIn you can only connect to people you've worked with, Gmail has max of 7GB storage tr -d '\r' <  > __, Apple doesn't allow porn,  and so onâ€¦<!--more-->

That's what makes them special and valued. Human mind really cannot value unlimited in a way it values limited. Limited serves economically.

What's is it that every person / product / service in your industry has but you won't have it?
