  thesis_post_image_alt: Text Message on iPhone - Looking for Customers
---
I am 18 and I want a credit card. Guess what? In this world where they cold call to make you buy your 10<sup>th</sup> credit card, I can’t have one. Reason?<!--more-->

They are looking for customers in all the wrong places.

Well someone could say that I have not tried enough and I might agree but that’s what an entrepreneur sees and fixes innit? Everyday, you lose me as your customer, and Shiraz – who is a close friend and Jane who is Shiraz’s girlfriend.

You loose!

Don’t go where the world goes to look for customer, go where the customer needs your service the most. <a title="I need you to be there" href="http://www.64notes.com/business-secret-pleasers">I need you to be there</a> where they just accept credit card (God knows why), where I just need you and no one else. I will say, “I love you!”

It’s so much more effective than calling me when I am chatting with my girlfriend. I will say “F*ck Off!”

You choose.
