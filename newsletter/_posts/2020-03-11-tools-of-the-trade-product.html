<h3>What's up?</h3>
<p>*redacted*</p>
<p>A section where I talk about what's new follow on twitter or subscribe to the newsletter for this.</p>

<hr>

<p>Once you define a problem; usually solutions and ideas are a dime a dozen. The challenge is not the brightest idea in the room.</p>

<p>The challenge usually becomes these layers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Privatisation, Economics of the Idea</li>
  <li>Plausibility</li>
  <li>Risk Assessment</li>
  <li>Measurability </li>
  <li>Taste & Control</li>
  <li>and more</li>
</ul>

<p>Successful products bridge the gap between all these layers. They make it easy to create art or solve problems. Some examples:</p>


<h2>Apple Pencil + iPad Pro + Procreate for Art</h2>

<p>From YouTube, Instagram to Dribble and Behance — the combo of these two tools have become the tool of choice for many professional graphic designers, illustrators, artists, comic creators and others.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="https://galshir.com/">Gal Shir's</a> work. Gal and many artists like him been at it since over a decade. With these tools — I see them doing it more work at scale.</p>

<p>Some key ways it bridges the gap:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No more frustration of supplies running out at the last moment</li>
  <li>Always available</li>
  <li>Mobile</li>
  <li>The existing skill of gesture control and taste still works with very minute adjustments</li>
</ul>


<h2>TikTok & Snapchat for Creative Videos</h2>

<p>It's easy to think of a funny situation, but what if you could enact it? </p>

<p>What used to take knowledge of Adobe After Effects and years of training is now a filter away. From re-enacting your favourite scene for an Indian soap opera to creating video memes have never been this easy.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@i_gopi/video/6802515579929398529">this crazy creative guy</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kingsidharth_">yours truly</a>.</p>

<h2>No-Code apps for Automation & Building Functionality</h2>

<p>With apps like Airtable, Webflow, Notion, and more — creating a mini-app, a close to a functional prototype, trying to the basic tech for a startup idea has become 100x easier.</p>

<p>Imagine a generation that grows up with these tools.</p>

<p>Some key ways they bridge the gap:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tools to create tools — mould it to suit your needs</li>
  <li>Understanding of nuances</li>
  <li>Building a community around for evangelism and support</li>
  <li>Focus on removing mundane patterns across workflows</li>
</ul>

<h2>Twitter for Conversations</h2>

<p>While posts with words are ubiquitous on all platforms — but by making them the central theme and disposable has changed the way we have conversations. </p>

<p>While this has happened, both, in a healthy and unhealthy direction; for me twitter has amplified serendipity more than anything else ❤️</p>


<h2>Figma for visual communication</h2>

<p>It wrapped the shop of an entire stack (Sketch > Animation Tool > Hand-off Tool) within a short period. </p>

<p>From prototypes, animated presentations, illustrations, etc. you can do a lot more in Figma than you could with many tools combined.</p>

<p>What's your favourite product or example? How does the product you're working on helps bridge this gap?</p>
