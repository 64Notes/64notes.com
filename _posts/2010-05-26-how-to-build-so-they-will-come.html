There is always a debate between those who believe '<em>Build and They Will Come</em>' and those who don't. Both have evidences to support their points. Which one works? Before you get into debate tr -d '\r' <  > __<!--more-->
<h3>Build With Them</h3>
Let's take a different approach altogether and '<em>Build With Them</em>'. Build it with your customer tr -d '\r' <  > __.

<strong>Involve them and make them feel important because they are. They are so important that there is no fun of building if they won't come.</strong>
<h3>But Don't Let Them Lead!</h3>
But then there is something that some fools do tr -d '\r' <  > __

Lead them, chase your vision and involve them. Social media is a great tool to do that.

Their involvement doesn't mean that they will change or shape your decision - <a title="they are there to support it" href="http://www.64notes.com/turn-customers-into-brand-advocates">they are there to support it</a>. <strong>Don't ask them if they want it or not, ask them how they want it, how much they want to pay for it and stuff like that.</strong>

Think again, you can save millions on market research. It's guerrilla testing for your ideas.

Build with them, not only will they come but bring likes of them along.
